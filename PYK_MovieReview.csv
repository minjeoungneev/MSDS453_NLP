PYK_Doc1_Equilibrium,"In the first years of the 21st century, a third World War broke out. Those who survived knew that mankind could never survive a fourth; the volatile nature of human beings would only increase, ensuring continued ruination. So, with classic governmental overreach on the horizon, a new organization is formed: the Grammaton Cleric, whose elite soldiers have only one purpose  to eradicate the true source of man's inhumanity to man, which is his ability to feel. In walks John Preston (Christian Bale), a first-class cleric, tasked with wiping out yet another stronghold of emotion and creativity  a stash house of music, art, books, and various trinkets that reflect the remnants of traditional human society. In a rather unintentionally comical moment, Preston stares down the recovered Mona Lisa painting before ordering it to be burned. In this peaceful yet bleak future, any item that might spark feelings is dubbed EC-10 or ""sense offense"" material, which warrants immediate destruction. A drug called Prozium is administered to citizens at regular intervals (mandated by alarm bells sounded off in the city centers and available at Equilibrium buildings), which helps suppress emotions on a personal, chemical basis. But despite all of these precautions, including Vice Counsel Dupont (Angus MacFadyen) routinely interviewing his staff, Preston's partner Errol Partridge (Sean Bean) succumbs to the forbidden, finer things in life  such as poetry by Yeats. After discovering Partridge's indiscretions, John executes the man, betraying no emotion at all. Or does he? With each criminal he apprehends, Preston begins to realize that living without feelings negates the very reason to be alive. It may be a complete rip-off of ""1984""  and by extension, ""Brazil,"" ""Gattaca,"" and ""The Matrix""  or any of the other countless, futuristic, oppressive-regime/soul-crushing, postapocalyptic civilization movies, but ""Equilibrium"" is one of the better ones. If a picture is going to borrow heavily from works before it, it might as well loot from the best. It also helps tremendously that writer/director Kurt Wimmer was able to acquire such a talented cast  from Bale's efficiency as a dispassionate soldier to the high caliber of notable supporting players like Emily Watson, Sean Bean, and William Fichtner. Even child star Matthew Harbour is exceptional. Great actors, however, can't solely redeem the more mediocre materials in play. There are plenty of overly familiar ideas, such as a Resistance, the ""processing"" of underground fighters, and the involvement of an unseen, supreme leader named ""Father."" To counter this, there are also a few new concepts, such as the gunkata martial arts form (essentially kung-fu with shooting weapons) and the parallels of Preston's downward spiral with that of his partner (along with the well-kept secrets of his wife and children). Unfortunately, rather than exploring the thought-provoking side of fascistic rule, or the tragedies of discovering the righteousness of the opposition and failing to protect loved ones, ""Equilibrium"" goes for the heavy-handed approach. Shooting puppies, striking absurd poses, and abusing slow-motion for the sake of over-the-top action sequences might play up to the target audience, but these methods only work to deprive the filmmakers from realizing this project's full potential. Still, the costuming, set designs, and music (by Klaus Badelt, which is actually spectacular) are far more impressive than anyone might expect. And the finale, though riddled with excessive silliness in its choreography, possesses a few shots (particularly one that artistically cuts back to a shocking demise) that transcend the mindless action angle to glimpse the sci-fi ingenuity buried beneath."
PYK_Doc2_Equilibrium,"Equilibrium is my favorite movie of 2002. It feels uncomfortable even typing those words, as they sound like the typical soundbite blurb-speak that passes for so much of film criticism these days. But it's true: This medium-budgeted, futuristic action tale that arrives on screens with precious little fanfare is, to my mind, the best film I've seen all year. It's a movie that thrilled and moved and deeply affected me when I got the chance to see it at a very early advance screening last July, and hasn't been out of my mind in the months since. I've been heaping praise on it for so many months  to friends, colleagues, family...pretty much anyone who'd listen  that it almost feels like I've written this review already. Writer/director Kurt Wimmer has delivered an intelligent and honorable riff on such science fiction classics as George Orwell's 1984, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, presenting a not-too-distant future where freedom has been traded for security (a timely subject these days!) through the State-mandated use of emotion-suppressing drugs. War and crime and hate are things of the past in Equilibrium's world, but so are art and creativity and love. This nightmare is presided over by the Big Brother-like dictator Father, and enforced by a quasi-religious order of ""Clericks,"" whose incredible combat skills are unleashed on ""sense offenders"" who have gone off the drugs that keep the populace docile. A terrifying future, to be sure, though not one without hope  especially when Clerick John Preston (Christian Bale, a much more impressive action hero here than he was fighting dragons in Reign of Fire) accidentally misses his drug dose and begins to feel for the first time. I hesitate to reveal much more about the plot of Equilibrium, jammed as it is with surprise and invention  suffice to say, this is an intellectual rollercoaster ride, as cerebral as it is visceral; both a bleak glimpse into a possible future and a stirring tribute to the indomitable human spirit. Though the film gets immeasurable mileage out of its cinematography, stunning futuristic production design, and music (an awesome neo-Wagnerian choral score by Klaus Badelt, a frequent collaborator of Hans Zimmer), it's (not surprisingly) the performers who give the proceedings so much gravity. Bale has never been better, combining the sleek coldness that served him so well as Patrick Bateman in American Psycho with a heartbreaking portrayal of a man rediscovering his lost humanity (and paying for the recovery of that humanity: Wimmer cleverly has the violence become more intense and wrenching as Preston learns to feel again). Bale is strongly supported by Emily Watson (one of the most soulful actresses working today, here perfectly cast as a beautiful sense offender who spurs Preston's rebellion against the system), Taye Diggs (having a wicked good time as Preston's suspicious partner), and Angus MacFadyen (sinister and oddly mournful as the head Clerick). This is a cast who seem to be giving their all in the service of a brilliant script, and guided all the way by a superb director. Since so much of the advance word on Equilibrium has centered around its potent action content, I feel the need to comment on that aspect: Besides being an exceptional film in any genre, it's also the action movie to beat for the year. One can easily imagine filmmakers like John Woo or the Wachowski Brothers watching Equilibrium and being stunned at how much Wimmer has upped the stakes in pure kinetic mayhem. The gunplay, hand-to-hand combat, and swordplay (yes  swordplay!) are so staggering in execution that  for this aspect alone  no self-respecting action fan can afford to miss this movie. To draw this review to a close, the biggest compliment I can pay Equilibrium is this: I cannot wait to see it again. As a critic, I saw it for free the first time around, but  besides wanting to experience the film once more  I really want to ""vote with my wallet"" as a consumer and help this movie make the money it so richly deserves. Quite awhile back  long before seeing this film  I speculated to a friend what might have happened had the great Stanley Kubrick (God rest his soul!) decided, with his cinematic skill and intellectual weight, to make a kick-ass, post-Matrix action movie. Now I have the answer to that question, and the name of the movie is Equilibrium."
PYK_Doc3_Equilibrium,"If I was to explain this movie to someone in one sentence it would be this: ""George Orwell meets John Woo"". I thought about Orwell he'd probably approve of this film. The center for which all the soldiers come from is called ""Equilibrium"" or balance as it is layman's terms; they're all injected with an opium drug that they carry that numbs their emotions and sense of guilt while they're controlled by the heavily armed heavily secure government facility. Paired with incredible direction and writing by Kurt Wimmer and sleek stylish cinematography by Dion Beebe, we're given a glimpse into a world that's still imperfect despite it being under control. In a society now completely void of emotion, heavily armed guards patrol the streets with the use of their skilled warriors called the Grammaton Clericks, a band of sleek swift emotionless soldiers who can take on a horde of rebels without breaking a sweat. Their best soldier is Sean Preston, an emotionless professional and violent soldier who one day remembers his wife whom he betrayed to be killed for feeling and now his memories begin flooding back as well with his emotions after he betrays his partner Partridge (Sean Bean) who he discovered with a book. Now, as his memories come back and emotions emerge, he must keep his emotions in tact while attempting to help the rebels and stay one step ahead of his eager young partner Brandt (Taye Diggs) a soldier almost equal in skill and abilities who is anxious to discover his secret and further his own career. The soldiers sit in a stadium where they're fed messages from the high father who watches over Libria, and everyone is monitored for emotions ala ""1984."" Those found with contraband including books, records, literature or art are killed and then the contraband is properly burned ala ""Farenheit 451"". It's obvious by looking at the facility that the government doesn't have much faith in their process as they watch everyone, including their best soldier Preston. He himself is plagued with traces of emotions and his haunting memory of selling his wife out to the authorities causing her death all the while hiding his emotions from his colleagues and his young son who is also being tailored as a clerick and watches him like a hawk as well. Christian Bale portrays a warrior without emotion, a warrior who kills without mercy and then must slowly progress into a man who's emotions are slowly coming back to him and express his realization towards those emotions, and Bale handles it with impressive range and incredible depth. Diggs play well against Preston as his rival constantly monitoring him and attempting to outdo him while Preston must stay one step ahead of him in his struggle with his emotions. There are many memorable scenes in the film, some utterly fantastic, and some fantastic for being so simple. Wimmer, obviously a martial arts movie buff creates some incredible and stylistic action sequences with the help of some truly good direction and choreography that make for some of the best scenes in the film. There are some incredible action scenes, and much swordplay as well as much gunplay and maneuvers that are satisfying fodder the film. ""Equilibrium"" a fantastic action science fiction entry, with excellent direction by Kurt Wimmer that channels the themes of George Orwell and the action of John Woo wonderfully."
PYK_Doc4_Equilibrium,"Pilfered though it is from many superior (and not-so-superior) sources, Equilibrium has a lot more to offer than you'd expect. Dimension Films (the genre branch of Miramax) sat on it for over a year before finally dumping it into a paltry 301 screens in a December death slot against the big year-end films (i.e., The Two Towers and its like). It didn't even get a chance to make back its relatively low $20 million budget  it grossed just over $1 million before disappearing from theaters in three weeks. The movie deserves far better. Equilibrium is not the most original movie to come down the pike  it's indebted to your choice of dystopian science fiction (1984, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, The Matrix, Gattaca)  but it's a sleek and forceful film of its kind, with some of the most eye-boggling gunfight scenes in recent memory. They're not even gunfights  they're more like systematic gun massacres, begun and finished in an eyeblink, with shooter and targets close enough to kiss. John Preston (Christian Bale), a ""Grammaton Cleric"" (i.e., assassin for the government), does far more shooting than kissing. John is one of the black-clad enforcers of the new world order: in the post-WWIII fascist state of Libria, it has been determined that war and violence can be blamed solely on emotion, so all emotions have been outlawed. Scruffy bands of resistance fighters, who have refused to take their daily dose of the emotion-killing drug Prozium, gather together to appreciate art, music, film  contraband works of beauty (which are illegal because they inspire feeling). John is a complete moral and emotional blank, which means he's the best at his job, and his two children, raised (like him) on a steady diet of Prozium, are likewise empty. John was married once, but his wife became a ""sense offender,"" rebelling against the emotionless world, and was summarily executed while John stood nearby, not bothered in the slightest. Such a man could never carry a movie if there weren't a change of heart  or, in John's case, an introduction of heart  in store for him. Christian Bale plays the early scenes almost as a sequel to his dead-zone Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, as if Bateman had finally found his niche as a callous destroyer in the bleak world of Libria and was handed a badge and a gun. But little by little, emotion invades his shell. His partner Partridge (Sean Bean) succumbs to the poetry of Yeats; John neutrally pulls Partridge's plug, but with the tiniest flicker of doubt (""I'll do what I can to see that they go easy on you,"" he says, an odd sentiment for someone supposedly without sentiment). Later, John drops one of his Prozium capsules, but instead of getting a replacement, he begins to have feelings. Some viewers may complain that John, conveniently for the plot, has an emotionally tough day ahead of him the same morning he goes Prozium-free; but he may have had many days just like it while cushioned from the emotional drain. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer gives us the same future-noir premise that served Steven Spielberg well in Minority Report  in both, a seasoned and skilled cog in the machine is content to work unquestioningly within the system, until the system turns on him. With a dash of wit, Wimmer even gives John a cute puppy to contend with, not to mention Emily Watson (in what amounts to an extended cameo) as Mary, a ""sense offender"" whose Beethoven record touches John's underused soul, just like Alex in A Clockwork Orange. Fortunately, there's no strained romance in the works for John and Mary, just the smallest tremors of suppressed attraction (mostly his for her), and in any event her character serves chiefly as the doorway to the larger resistance movement, led by William Fichtner as a man who can feel, but has chosen not to allow himself to. Lots of ideas bounce around in this paranoid fantasy, and lots of implausibilities, too. (Wouldn't John and his fellow Clerics be subjected to regular blood or urine tests to be sure they're on their Prozium? Wouldn't there be a more high-tech way of sniffing out emotion than a polygraph test, which can be faked out?) But Equilibrium is still an engaging ride, with some quicksilver moves in store for the climax, including a swordfight between John and suspicious new partner Taye Diggs, and a swirling ballet of gunplay between John and Libria higher-up Angus MacFadyen. Many praised The Matrix for combining deep-dish philosophy and kick-ass anime style, but it's the underseen Equilibrium that really delivers the goods."
PYK_Doc5_Equilibrium,"""Equilibrium"" would be a mindless action picture, except that it has a mind. It doesn't do a lot of deep thinking, but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x, it does make a statement: Freedom of opinion is a threat to totalitarian systems. Dictatorships of both the left and right are frightened by the idea of their citizens thinking too much, or having too much fun. The movie deals with this notion in the most effective way, by burying it in the story and almost drowning it with entertainment. In a free society many, maybe most, audience members will hardly notice the message. But there are nations and religions that would find this movie dangerous. You know who you are. The movie is set in the 21st centuryhey! that's our century!at a time after the Third World War. That war was caused, it is believed, because citizens felt too much and too deeply. They got all worked up and started bombing each other. To assure world peace and the survival of the human race, everyone has been put on obligatory doses of Prozium, a drug that dampens the emotions and shuts down our sensual side. (Hint: The working title of this movie was ""Librium."") In the movie, enforcers known as Clerics have the mandate to murder those who are considered Sense Offenders. This is a rich irony, since True Believers, not Free Thinkers, are the ones eager to go to war over their beliefs. If you believe you have the right to kill someone because of your theology, you are going about God's work in your way, not His. Christian Bale stars in ""Equilibrium,"" as Cleric John Preston, partnered with Partridge (Sean Bean) as a top-level enforcer. Nobody can look dispassionate in the face of outrageous provocation better than Bale, and he proves it here after his own wife is incinerated for Sense Offenses. ""What did you feel?"" he is asked. ""I didn't feel anything,"" he replies, and we believe him, although perhaps this provides a clue about his wife's need to Offend. Preston is a top operative, but is hiding something. We see him pocketing a book that turns out to be the collected poetry of W.B. Yeats, a notorious Sense Offender. He has kept it, he explains, to better understand the enemy (the same reason censors have historically needed to study pornography). His duties bring him into contact with Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson), and he feelswell, it doesn't matter what he feels. To feel at all is the offense. Knowing that, but remembering Mary, he deliberately stops taking his Prozium: He loves being a Cleric, but, oh, you id. If ""Equilibrium"" has a plot borrowed from 1984, Brave New World and other dystopian novels, it has gunfights and martial arts borrowed from the latest advances in special effects. More rounds of ammunition are expended in this film than in any film I can remember, and I remember ""The Transporter."" I learn from Nick Nunziata at CHUD.com that the form of battle used in the movie is ""Gun-Kata,"" which is ""a martial art completely based around guns."" I credit Nunziata because I think he may have invented this term. The fighters transcribe the usual arcs in mid-air and do impossible acrobatics, but mostly use guns instead of fists and feet. That would seem to be cheating, and involves a lot of extra work (it is much easier to shoot someone without doing a back-flip), but since the result is loud and violent it is no doubt worth it. There is an opening sequence in which Preston and Partridge approach an apartment where Offenders are holed up, and Preston orders the lights to be turned out in the apartment. Then he enters in the dark. As nearly as I could tell, he is in the middle of the floor, surrounded by Offenders with guns. A violent gun battle breaks out, jerkily illuminated by flashes of the guns, and everyone is killed but Preston. There is nothing about this scene that even attempts to be plausible, confirming a suspicion I have long held, that the heroes of action movies are protected by secret hexes and cannot be killed by bullets. There are a lot more similar battles, which are pure kinetic energy, made of light, noise and quick cutting. They seem to have been assembled for victims of Attention Deficit Syndrome, who are a large voting block at the box office these days. The dispassionate observer such as myself, refusing to Sense Offense my way through such scenes, can nevertheless admire them as a technical exercise. What I like is the sneaky way Kurt Wimmer's movie advances its philosophy in between gun battles. It argues, if I am correct, that it is good to feel passion and lust, to love people and desire them, and to experience voluptuous pleasure through great works of music and art. In an early scene Cleric Preston blow-torches the 'Mona Lisa,' the one painting you can be pretty sure most moviegoers will recognize. But in no time he is feeling joy and love, and because he is the hero, this must be good, even though his replacement partner, Cleric Brandt (Taye Diggs), suspects him, and wants to expose him. The rebel group in ""Equilibrium"" preserves art and music (there is a touching scene where Preston listens to a jazz record), and we are reminded of Bradbury and Truffaut's ""Fahrenheit 451,"" where book lovers committed banned volumes to memory. One is tempted to look benevolently upon ""Equilibrium"" and assume thought control can't happen here, but of course it can, which is why it is useful to have an action picture in which the Sense Offenders are the good guys.t"
PYK_Doc6_Equilibrium,"A tedious rip-off sci-fi film, itching to be another Matrix (or, maybe just a bearable flick!), that brazenly steals everything from Orwell's 1984 novel and many other thinking man's films, with the same Dystopian agenda, such as Fahrenheit 451. It offers for the viewers of the more low rent sci-fi films the required martial-arts fight sequences and plenty of metallic techno gadgetry; and, it appeals to a more arty audience by its cleverly created totalitarian gothic set design of mixing actual Berlin locations with CGI effects. Nevertheless, it fails overall to arouse interest dramatically, conceptually or inventively. I've seen this film's theme played out too often (and in a more spirited way) in recent films to find its well-intentioned virtues necessarily welcome or pleasing. It only adds unneeded celluloid to an increasingly tired genre! Director-writer Kurt Wimmer (1995-""One Man's Justice""), a screenwriter for such films as the 1998-""Sphere,"" the 1999-""The Thomas Crown Affair"" and the 2003-""The Recruit,"" never got this 'baby' off the ground. The banal dialogue was risible (a prime example has the humanist heroine played by Emily Watson in all seriousness state: ""Without love, breath is just a clock ticking""), the main action hero, Christian Bale, was miscast. His stiff actions were too self-conscious and deliberate to fill the role of an action hero. The bleak settings were uninspiring; the overall grey effect was more stunting than enlightening. What becomes most annoying is that it strings together a bunch of cliches from just about every sci-fi film and the melodrama never becomes anything more than a silly exercise in acting silly. It's a film that, quite frankly, offers little entertainment value or much of anything else (it even fails to answer most of the challenging questions it raises about state-controlled suppression). Equilibrium takes place in a futuristic world in the 21st-century post-WWIII. It resembles a fascist state where books are burned and no emotions are allowed in the belief this will prevent an uprising and another world war. John Preston (Christian Bale) is the highest ranking Grammaton ninjalike cleric in Libria, where he's a police enforcer (using a new fight technique called ""Gun-Kata"") going on missions to root out all rebels who haven't taken their required daily dose of the emotion suppressing Prozium; and, he's also around to rid the world of literature, art and sentimental relics of the past. Preston catches cleric partner Partridge (Sean Bean) sneaking off with a book of poetry by WB Yeats, and turns him over to the state authorities. Partridge's expected fate is as doomed as Preston's wife, who was executed for Sense Offences (leaving him a widower with two children, one of them training in the monastery to be a cleric). But the tricky Partridge before he departs this dystopia, tells his robotic partner ""I spread my dreams under your feet."" Before you can say 'let's burn some more books' all of the following things happen to Preston: he's given a new uptight cleric partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs), who may be able to read his mind, he's impressed with the unrepentant sense offender he arrestedMary O'Brien (Emily Watson), and he's letting some feelings into his hard interior as he takes pity on a stray puppy. This leads him to tell his big boss, Dupont (Angus MacFadyen), he wants to go after and permanently wipe out the underground movement (those that have stopped taking their drugs and are trying to save the items that have been banned). But Preston has become converted to the rebel's side by the feelings seeping through him, and he now aims to kill his society's leaderFather (another way of saying Big Brother)with the help of the underground workers, and therefore hopes by contacting the rebels it will lead to a revolution."
PYK_Doc7_Equilibrium,"Cliched and miserable attempt to unite the geniuses of Brave New World, 1984, and the Matrix. Utter filth. Here's a true story: This evening, I went to see a movie called ""Equilibrium."" Now normally, I save every movie ticket and throw them in a shoebox filled with precious mementos. On my trip through the parking lot, I pulled out my Zippo and proceeded to burn it. Then proceeded to speed home, so I could take an extremely violent crap. I don't know what was worse; how painful the bowel movement was, or how painful the movie was. Roger Ebert gave this movie 3 stars out of 4. As soon as I'm done writing this review, I'm going to track him down and force-feed him his review. Laced with Strychnine. I realize you're probably thinking, ""Shouldn't the punishment fit the crime?"" But frankly, I'm a busy man, and I don't have time for 6 months of chakra torture. I suppose you're expecting some sort of review of the movie, so I guess I should make an attempt. Then again, if I put as much effort into this review as writer/director Kurt Wimmer put into his screenplay, I could call it a day right now. ""Equilibrium"" gives us a society, Libria, which is opiated by a drug known as Librium, a necessity after World War III. The survivors in power decided that it was man's emotion that led to war, and in order to prevent any such future occurrences, they constructed a society based on emotionless. This is aided by the destruction of all art, music, and cultural relics, not to mention 3 doses a day of the aforementioned Librium injection. Those who forsake the drug are known as ""Sense Offenders,"" and these criminals are tended to by an elite class of soldiers known as Clericks. And by ""tended to,"" I mean ""Terminated with extreme prejudice."" Within the first 20 minutes of the film, we've encountered Clerick John Preston, watched him kill his partner for being a sense offender, and discovered his wife was executed for Sense offenses 4 years earlier. But thanks to his Librium doses, he doesn't seem to mind much. Watching this movie, I suddenly wished they made a drug which made horrible movies good. All is well and good in emotionless Libria, until Preston accidentally knocks a vial of his Librium off the bathroom sink, and doesn't have time to pick up another dose. Suddenly, he is overwhelmed with emotion, and continues to abstain from his medication, leading him to question authority and rebel. And by ""rebel,"" I mean ""Terminate with extreme prejudice."" I suppose you're expecting me to say something along the lines of, ""At this point, the movie degenerates into a Matrix-wannabe."" Unfortunately, the movie was that from the moment Preston and his partner show up to tend to the first lot of sense offenders. Christian Bale was dripping with Keanuosity, from the slicked-back black hair, black garb, and generally emotionless acting ability. Although one would be hesitant to mention the dullness of his performance, given the fact he was on the drug, he was only on the drug for the first 20 minutes. After that, I would've expected him to suddenly become warm and likeable. Instead, he merely dives into his best Keanu Reeves impersonation and begins dealing with ludicrous amounts of heavily armed soldiers in his attempt to overthrow Libria's regime. And by ""dealing with,"" I mean, ""Terminating with extreme prejudice."" During the course of the movie, we are subjected to no less than 6 major gunfight scenes, not a single one of them memorable. The Clericks display incredible superhuman agility and strength, which would be fine if this was the Matrix, but this isn't. It's set in the future, in the real world, and yet we're supposed to digest the idea that humans can jump 20 feet into the air and dodge the bullets of 20 close-range gunman using ""statistical probability."" I suppose by now you're thinking to yourself, ""This movie sounds awful. I should go see it just for the cheese factor."" This is where I warn you that I saw the Transporter and the One, and I enjoyed both on a cheesy action movie level. I feel confident saying this movie makes abysmal blush. Gut-wrenchingly-awful could stand next to this movie and therefore look attractive in comparison. After seeing this movie, ritual seppuku seemed like a fun way to pass the time. This movie will be the low marks on the resumes of actors and actresses like Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, Sean Bean, and Emily Watson. Kurt Wimmer, whose visuals were forgettable and his screenplay full of cliches and attempts to rip off many other successful movies and books, will hopefully never write a screenplay again. And I sincerely hope the entire special effects team returns to throwing together low-budget effects for advertising, because Terminator 2 had more believable special effects. In short: Do not see this movie. Ever. If you see it on movie store shelves, run in the opposite direction screaming. If not for yourself, then at least for the children. Do it for the children."
PYK_Doc8_Equilibrium,"Movies are hard. They require a lot of work from everyone. One element goes wrong, and the work of many people could be negated. This is why I don't usually geIt angry when I see bad movies. Somebody tries to the best of their abilities with the budget they have and brings a project to a completion. That's respectable. But this lazy Matrix wannabe with bad CGI, the incredibly childish ""gun katta"" fighting, and a ridiculous premise makes me angry and sad that Sean Bean and Christian Bale took their time to star in this, when they could've been making better movies. These kinds of cash-grabs do make me angry. But at least such movies usually get panned by the public and we never hear anything about them ever again. The fact that this thing received positive reviews from the public made me think that either I saw a different film than everybody else or this world needs to be set on fire, along with the modern film industry, if this kind of garbage is going to be an acceptable standard for entertainment from now on. Let us start with the plot: in the future feelings are illegal. ....................... Turn this s**t off right now. You can just turn it off right there. What else do you need to know? How can anyone in their right mind still proceed to watch something when the main idea is so insultingly stupid? How can you believe a single thing shown on the screen with that as the back story? Here is a better premise I just came up with: in the future people only have one leg and must touch a pickle every 24 hours with their left index finger so that Hollywood executives can keep getting paid for artistically bankrupt content. Who keeps coming up with this stuff? Does someone get paid for it? Can I join in on the scam? If you manage to get past this, then what you get is a cheap looking Matrix rip-off, mostly a stylistic rip-off but the story is not that different either if you think about it. The protagonists are wearing jackets they fished out of the bin outside of the Matrix Reloaded studio and are carrying Desert Eagles as their weapons of choice - you know, those giant pistols you see in Pamela Anderson's productions and other 90's direct-to-video action movies showing up on your TV at 1AM in the morning. I bet the actors were happy with that stupid premise though, because it means they can all be emotionless, you know, because that is why they get paid large amounts of money, to look like a wooden plank with guns attached. There is not much more to be told about the plot or the characters because...well, honestly, because I can hardly remember anything and I fear that if I try to remember then I will just bring up more painfully dumb plot points that I so successfully repressed. Visually, the movie is style over substance and simplistic style at that. The sets look cheap, minimalistic and dark. At other times, we are treated to the computer effects your 10-year-old son made on his PC. At first, the characters wear black, but then this one guy has a change of heart and starts wearing all white. Somebody hold me, so I don't fall. I need my heart pills after witnessing such complicated breathtaking symbolism. But wait, the most priceless is the action itself. The characters are fighting with guns...no, no, no, I don't mean ""fighting"" as in ""wage war"", I mean they are physically dancing around in hand-to-hand combat while shooting their pistols, making 180 degree turns like they are doing ballet. And once they are done with that, they take out their katana swords, because that is cool to the 8-year-old who wrote the script. This film is a pinnacle of bad action movies from 2000s. It is like an 80s action flick but with none of the charm to compensate for the poor quality. I dislike this movie, but I mostly loathe the people who watched it and considered it a fine picture. Normally, I don't hate on others for liking something I don't like, because I recognize that some things are just not for me. If I get to watch war movies, it is only fair that someone else gets to watch drawn out melodrama that would make my teeth ache. But every now and then, I am reminded that somewhere out there is a dude who likes the concept of pistol fighting and katanas in a poorly rendered futuristic setting and this dude is not 8 years old anymore and belongs to the same human race as me, and that feels insulting."
PYK_Doc9_Equilibrium,"I too was fooled by the reviews on this site into believing that this film was watch-able. What a waste of $5.75 and 107 minutes of my life that I will never get back. I'm sorry but whomever tries to praise this movie obviously has very little knowledge of film or is so brain dead and numbed by ""cool guns"" that they actually think this movie is remotely good. As soon as Sean Bean died this movie just went downhill. I honestly feel sorry that so many talented actors were suckered into starring in the next Robot Jox. It's not hard being wooden as an actor and I do have respect for Bale, but this dead-pan ""anti-emotion"" thing just wasn't happening with me. The plot is a rehashed cheese 1984 meets Darkman. Talk about bad. I won't knock Weimer though. This was his first film and I can only hope that this movie was severely edited or had lots of script changes due to budget constraints and production house pressures. Maybe he took it upon himself to take credit (or more like blame) for the writing. Some films that were supposed to be excellent have been hampered by studio interference. Maybe Weimer wasn't big on standing up to the production house or maybe, just maybe, his direction and writing really is that bad. Though I certainly hope that I am wrong about the latter statement. Alien 3 is a good example of a noble idea being tarnished by the production company. A good director (David Fincher) who was so disappointed with the studio control that he walked out on it! Did Weimer do the same thing? I hope there was at least some dissent between his ""idea"" and Dimension Films'. Hopefully he will do better the next time around but, then again, some directors never learn from their mistakes. Stuart Baird is a good example. Speaking of which, this and Star Trek Nemesis rank among the lamest Sci-Fi films I have seen in recent times. A film that's supposed to be Sci-Fi has to at least be interesting. Sure the Matrix has ripped off other films but this one is so blatant and so badly completed that it doesn't deserve any good review in it's present state. The Action scenes are pretty weak for 20 million. If you want to see how a good low-budget action film is made check out El Mariachi. I believe it was done on a budget of about $7,000. Legions beyond this. Again, I don't want to rip into Weimer but I have to say that if his next film is as bad as this one, then I'll know that the reason Equilbrium was such a poor film was because of the direction. There's a good reason that this film was in limited release. IT SUCKED!"
PYK_Doc10_Equilibrium,"This narrative attempts to convey the idea that emotion has value, but fails to value emotion enough to give the movie emotional depth. Emotional intelligence score: 14 years old (male). Unsurprisingly, since music IS emotion, the soundtrack is glaringly bad: emotionally-inappropriate, plain awful scores, cringe-worthy especially during dramatic fight scenes, worsen by amateur audio mixing and compression. I like dramatic neoclassical-electro-pop, a la Batman or Blade Runner, not shallow grandeur electro-melodramatica that drown out dialog and smother to death the rare signs of authentic human emotions. The visual effect is either very good or exceptionally bad. Cinematic composition and especially close-ups and indoor scenes are very well done and original in visualization, given the relatively low budget. CGIs of city long shots and animations are simply pre-2000, full of glaring errors, even typical machinima cut scenes will fetch greater realism... Casting choices highly inconsistent. Christian Bale is in a lonely class of his own. Sean Bean and William Fichner were underused. Emily Watson is supposed to represent emotion, but her botox-frozen eyes and stiff too-groomed-for-prison lips failed to convey sorrow or fear. Dupont the leader is badly cast (or directed), no muscle tone no authority no weighty dramatic presence - a mere annoying chubby puppy barking unintelligibly at the sharp impeccable Christian Bale. At his most threatening moments, Dupont manages to act the soft flabby-cheek lawyer mumbling some pretentious overly-wordy threats. His idea of conveying authority is throwing a lame saliva-flying table-banging temper tantrum. Which brings us to... THE MEANING OF EMOTION (according to Kurt Wimmer) Apparently there're only a few women left in the city. But of course - the convention is women are ""emotional"", men are...cool? In the brave new world of mid 21st century, it seems women will still being scapegoated as ""the more emotional"" sex, because they just like to hoard pretty antique stuff so they will more likely to be exterminated. Most men are less into frilly stuff, so they will obediently inject themselves with emotional botox and go around efficiently killing those unrepentant feminine-minded music-appreciating losers who hoard books and vinyls. Yep... The writer director failed to understand entry-level human psychology vocab: Emotions and feelings, technically, aren't the same. Sensation is an even more distinct thing. To Kurt Wimmer, emotions, feelings, sensations mean the same thing - BUT - anger, paranoia, fear, competitiveness, domineering and controlling impulse, killing thirst, are not emotions or feelings. So what is feelings to Kurt? SENTIMENT. Sentimental attachment to family photos, little personal objects, art, domesticated animals, paintings. Yep...you know, chick stuff. HATRED (of anything including people with unacceptable behaviors) are apparently not an emotion, nor war-inducing, by the law of Equilibrium society. THE NEED TO KILL OFF A PERCEIVED THREAT (a.k.a. paranoia) is apparently not an emotion also. Equilibrium's masters, including the protagonist, are THAT stupid. This is a classic case of the typical aggressive males feeling shame for feeling anything at all - hence failing to classify their own most frequent emotional experience as emotions. No wonder war and mass killing happen. Accordingly to this classic-fallacy: school children shooting psychopaths are just being ""unemotional"" as they fire on at innocent victims, you know. Anger doesn't count as emotion. Blinding hatred, meh, is not emotion. Mass shooters are not being emotional. They are so not hysterical (like women). They are ""just being efficient"". Statistically economical, a cold calculating math genius. So cool. So unemotional. And Kurt Wimmer wanted to comment on the emotion that causes war. LOL. I really wish he was being ironic. But unfortunately the story tone is dead serious. Summary: art-appreciation is emotional and causes war. Emotional-repression and systematic killing (a.k.a. WAR) don't cause war. (???!!!) Mommies and softy men are war criminals so mostly dead. A human race as hysterical and ridiculously dumb as this will last more than one generation. Right... The movie is a fail for me, in spite of Christian Bale's performance. Bale's emotional range and control, his near-perfect physique and martial art mastery, and the gungfu choreography, are the things worth watching in this movie. Everything else can be summed up as another Nolan-wannabe's emotionally-shallow, philosophically-lame technically-uneven piece of egoistical product. Recommended only for bored weekday evenings."
