101,ALG_Doc1_Mean_Girls,ALG_Doc1_Mean_Girls,ALG,Comedy,Positive,Mean_Girls,"Mean Girls is a movie that needs no introduction. The Tina Fey-penned 2004 movie about Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) transferring to an American high school after years of being homeschooled by her parents on another continent, then attempting to help her new friends take down the clique of popular girls, is jam-packed with iconic lines and moments that have earned it a reputation as a teen comedy classic. What defies logic is that, in spite of this, there is indeed more to dig into while celebrating the movie on its 20th anniversary. The ensuing 20 years have now seen two additional Mean Girls movies join the franchise, one of which adapted the Broadway musical adaptation of the original movie, which itself ran for 833 performances before closing amid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. But despite countless re-interpretations of the material on top of endless regurgitations of its most popular moments in the form of gifs and memes across social media, the movie still possesses the same zip and vigor that made it a hit when it first premiered two decades ago, grossing a staggering $130.1 million against its $18 million budget. By far the element that makes the movie stand out most is the Mean Girls cast, which is one of the most unimpeachable ensembles ever assembled for a teen movie. Like all the best ensembles, there is no true standout. At any given moment it may seem like whoever is currently onscreen couldn't possibly be anything but Best in Show. However, the movie probably could not survive without Lindsay Lohan's performance imbuing Cady with enough relatable vulnerability to keep us on her side even when she has lost herself to the allure of the Mean Girl lifestyle. In addition to the stellar work put in by Lohan's co-stars, particularly Rachel McAdams (relishing pure nastiness), Lacey Chabert (weaponizing cluelessness), Amanda Seyfried (beamed in from another planet), Daniel Franzese (crafting a wholly unique character from the word ""go""), and Lizzy Caplan (sharpening sarcasm to a deadly point), a hearty helping of Saturday Night Live veterans including Tim Meadows, Amy Poehler, Ana Gasteyer, and Fey herself round out the adult cast to add the perfect amount of spice wherever necessary. Terrible jokes delivered by this cast could land perfectly, but the Mean Girls screenplay is stuffed to the brim with sparkling humor that feels like nothing to come before or since, existing entirely within its own universe. As much as it looks back toward the teen genre that was, honoring ""mean girl"" classics like 1988's Heathers, the movie itself is all forward momentum, using its unique brand of caustic wit and oddball humor to carve its own path toward defining the future of what a teen movie can be and could possibly hope to be. Unfortunately, the unparalleled quality of the stars and the screenplay seem to have left director Mark Waters content to primarily stay out of his cast's way. Beyond the impeccable costume design by Mary Jane Fort, Mean Girls"
102,ALG_Doc2_Mean_Girls,ALG_Doc2_Mean_Girls,ALG,Comedy,Positive,Mean_Girls,"Teenage girls can be red in tooth and claw, in case you hadn't gotten the pop-culture memo. Films like Catherine Hardwicke's Thirteen and books like Rosalind Wiseman's Queen Bees & Wannabes have thrown a harsh light on teen girls' yearning for acceptance and struggles with self-esteem; Tina Fey, head writer on Saturday Night Live, read Wiseman's book, and Fey's resulting screenplay was so inspired by Queen Bees that Wiseman gets a screen credit. Mean Girls, which opened with surprisingly big numbers, may tap into the same zeitgeist that seeks to decode the unhappy daughters of a new generation. It's also considerably witty, with freshly conceived characters and a baroquely structured plot. Lindsay Lohan, whose popularity may be part of the reason for Mean Girls' success, is Cady Heron, a homeschooled girl attending a public school for the first time. Cady doesn't know the social rules of high school, though her new friends, outcast ""art freaks"" Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and Damien (Daniel Franzese), waste no time filling her in. Tina Fey, who is Class of 1988 like me, must've been as relieved  and as dispirited  as I was to learn that high-school cliques haven't changed much in fifteen years. The Queen Bee clique, derisively known as The Plastics, are a trio of well-appointed brats  airhead Karen (Amanda Seyfried), eager-to-please Gretchen (Lacey Chabert), and ringleader Regina (Rachel McAdams). They take notice of Cady, and Regina invites her into the fold, with Janis' enthusiastic approval  Cady is in the perfect covert-op position to report back to Janis on the Plastics' vapidity. Mean Girls is not just for teenage girls. For one thing, Fey and producer Lorne Michaels have brought along some fellow SNL talent  Tim Meadows as the grouchy school principal, Ana Gasteyer as Cady's anthropologist mom (her line ""Why are my tribal vases under the sink?"" is one of Fey's finer moments as a writer), and the incomparable Amy Poehler as Regina's mom, a teenage daughter's worst nightmare  the mom who wants to be one of the girls. This is perhaps the smartest film Michaels has had his name on; Cady is a math whiz, and the movie doesn't shy away from showing actual examples of her knowledge. Fey wants girls to know it's okay to be smart, and the subplot in which Cady dumbs herself down to win the affection of a hunky senior (Jonathan Bennett) is a good instance of Fey's unstressed message. Elsewhere, particularly towards the finish, the script gets a little preachier. Fey herself, in the role of Cady's calculus teacher, stands in front of an auditorium full of girls and makes a speech: ""You've got to stop calling each other sluts and whores. It just makes it all right for guys to call you that."" An inarguable sentiment, but it veers too close to a PSA for me, as does Cady's later revelation, ""Calling somebody else fat will not make you any thinner. Calling somebody stupid will not make you any"
103,ALG_Doc3_Mean_Girls,ALG_Doc3_Mean_Girls,ALG,Comedy,Positive,Mean_Girls,"Frequently hilarious teen comedy with a witty script and likeable characters  this is further proof that Lindsay Lohan is fast becoming THE teen star of the noughties. Director Mark Waters scored a massive hit last year with the hugely enjoyable remake of Freaky Friday, which earned Jamie Lee Curtis a Golden Globe nomination and also put Rising Teen Star Lindsay Lohan firmly on the map as someone to watch. Worthy Of Comparisons To Heathers Mean Girls re-teams Waters with Lohan and throws in a brilliantly witty script by Saturday Night Live alumnus Tina Fey, based on Rosalind Wiseman's bestseller Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and Other Realities Of Adolescence. The result is that rare thing  an enjoyable, genuinely hilarious teen comedy that's actually worthy of comparisons to Heathers. Lohan plays Cady Heron, a teenage girl who starts high school after having been home schooled in Africa till she was 16. She's quickly befriended by a quirky girl, Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and her gay best friend Damien (Daniel Franzese), but the Popular Girls ('The Plastics', headed by Rachel McAdams and Lacey Chabert) make a play for her too and her 'real' friends persuade her to infiltrate the Plastics so she can report back with juicy gossip for maximum sabotage. However the plan backfires and Cady finds herself becoming just as much of a bitch as her new 'friends'. Mean Girls has got pretty much everything you could want from a high school comedy - lots of hilarious, quotable lines, some great sight gags (a running gag comparing high school kids to the African wildlife; a terrifically executed 'horror movie' entrance; a very funny montage sequence of plans that misfire) and some revealing insights into modern high school life, such as with the three-way call ambush in which Girl A calls Girl B and invites her to bitch about Girl C, while unaware that Girl C is listening in. Care And Attention To Character Development Although ultimately not quite as deliciously dark as Heathers, Mean Girls definitely shares a certain cynical sensibility as well as a love of made-up teenspeak  witness Lacey Chabert's unsuccessful attempts to introduce ""totally fetch"" as a catchphrase throughout the film. Crucially, a lot of care and attention has gone into creating the characters, with the result that almost everybody gets a share of the funny lines, including the teachers. Of the cast, Lohan is the (ahem) obvious stand-out  she's completely adorable throughout the film and manages to retain our sympathy even when you gradually realise she's gone too far. The rest of the cast are extremely good, though Daniel Franzese deserves special mention for his work in the Gay Best Friend role (his talent show scene is hilarious) and screenwriter Tina Fey gives herself several great lines as Ms Norbury. In short, Mean Girls is a sharply written, well observed, smartly directed teen movie with likeable characters and several hilarious gags. Highly recommended."
104,ALG_Doc4_Mean_Girls,ALG_Doc4_Mean_Girls,ALG,Comedy,Positive,Mean_Girls,"High school will always essentially be the same  a hotbed of hormones and humiliation, with the occasional flicker of happiness  but the particulars of the experience change as often as teen fashion. Consider ""Mean Girls,"" then, to be this spring's ""Heathers,"" the 1989 dark comedy that has become the touchstone for all movies about high school cliques. It's not a rip-off in the least but a timely variation  so attuned to the nuances of today's teenage world, for girls in particular, that its emotional accuracy qualifies as brilliance. There seems to be one clear person to praise for this, and her identity may surprise you. ""Mean Girls""  about a homeschooled 15-year-old named Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan), who transfers to a public high school and gets eaten alive by the unfamiliar social structure  was written by Tina Fey, the ""Saturday Night Live"" scribe and news anchor who has a supporting role as a teacher here. ""Mean Girls"" seethes with experience, the sort of feminine ire that's more likely to come from Fey than director Mark Waters, who previously worked with Lohan on the hit remake ""Freaky Friday."" Yet no matter where the film's inspiration derives from  and maybe it's simply born of that collaborative alchemy that creates movie magic  there's no denying the result. ""Mean Girls"" dissects contemporary adolescence with withering precision. When Cady, a pretty and polite newcomer, arrives at North Shore High School in suburban Chicago, a few groups immediately try to claim her. Among them is a pair of outcasts  the proudly gay Damian (Daniel Franzese) and the bitter punk Janis (Lizzy Caplan)  who lay out the social landscape for Cady. At the top of the food chain are the Plastics, a trio of perfectly manicured girlfriends who lord over the school like royalty. When the Plastics try to adopt Cady, Damian and Janis suggest she go ""undercover"" to report back on how shallow they really are. Popularity, however, proves to be far more seductive than any of them realize. ""Mean Girls"" has a lacerating wit, as quick as ""Saturday Night Live"" at its best. When the movie takes a tour of the school's cliques  a staple of this sort of film  it has an extra bite. We don't just get the jocks and burnouts, for example, but also the ""sexually active band geeks."" More probing is its exploration of the image-obsessed mind of a modern high school girl. As the Plastics  played by Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried  ruthlessly criticize each inch of their own bodies, Cady says, ""I used to think there was just fat and skinny."" How did they get this way? The movie offers a satirical answer when it shows the little sister of one of the Plastics practicing the dance moves to a music video. Later, we glimpse her watching something that looks like ""Girls Gone Wild."" Adolescence is hard enough for girls, Fey seems to be saying,"
105,ALG_Doc5_Mean_Girls,ALG_Doc5_Mean_Girls,ALG,Comedy,Positive,Mean_Girls,"If you've seen Heathers, Clueless or Jawbreaker, then you've seen Mean Girls. Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) is the new girl, having moved from Africa where she was raised (one of many comic head-scratchers that goes nowhere), and now trying to win friends in a hostile new high school environment. On the verge of becoming--gasp!--friends with two geeks, one gay and one Goth, she is invited to join ""The Plastics"" (Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried), the coolest girls on campus. When she develops an unfortunate crush on the head Plastics' ex-boyfriend (Jonathan Bennett), the girls declare war on each other and all hell breaks loose. Saturday Night Live regulars Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Tim Meadows and Ana Gasteyer fill in the adult roles, and Fey wrote the script as well. Lohan has star power in spades, and enough going on behind the eyes to at least suggest the inner life and back story absent from the script. She conveys Cady's sudden character changes with aplomb, and her comic timing is excellent. McAdams makes the biggest impression with the showiest ""Plastics"" role and is certainly someone to watch for in the future. Her Regina George is one of the funniest, nastiest high school girls since Election's Tracy Flick. Bennett is likeable in a one-note jock role, and Daniel Franzese and Lizzy Caplan are similarly stereotyped as the Gay and the Goth, respectively. Of the adults, Poehler, who is always funny, stands out as Regina's alcoholic, mini-skirted mother. Fey wisely and selflessly wrote herself a straight-man role as the calculus teacher. And Meadows as the principal, quite simply, has never been funnier. Whether he has ever been funny before is another question. To take on a project already burdened with two strikes--Teen Comedy and SNL Movie--is either a bold move or career suicide, but director Mark S. Waters doesn't need to worry. He does a nice job of staying out of the way, and tells the story simply without relying too heavily on fruit-flavored set design, drowning every scene in music, or ruining the witty laughs with too much slapstick. And it is a very witty script, sharply observed and rich in detail. (The Halloween party scene, showing every single girl wearing lingerie and a different set of animal ears, stands out.) Fey adapted sociologist Rosalind Wiseman's nonfiction best-seller Queen Bees & Wannabees, and the interaction between the various species of teen is note perfect. That said, Fey seems to have been given a lot of leeway due to her stature on SNL, and it shows. One example: everyone has trouble pronouncing Cady's name, which wasn't funny the first time and still isn't 500 times later. The movie also attempts to impart a message of female solidarity, but by building the characters on the same cookie-cutter stereotypes it denounces, its girl power is undermined. Plus, the movie seems cut to within an inch of its life. If it is possible for a comedy to move too quickly, Mean Girls does, as"

The film begins with Cady Heron's first day of school. Cady (played by Ms. Lohan) has been home-schooled in Africa until her parents are relocated back to the US and suddenly she enters a new jungle known as high school, run by a teen queen lioness Regina George and her pussy power pride otherwise known as the ""Plastics."" Unlike most home schooled kids, Cady doesn't smell like pee, she is a ""regulation hottie"" as she is informed by two art geeks, Janis Ian (everybody's favourite lesbian) and her little gay friend Damian (Daniel Franzese). The three hatch a plan to destroy the plastics, which involves Cady spying on Regina (Rachel McAdams) and her two hench-ettes Gretchen Weiners (Lacey Chabert) and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). But she who looks into the abyss also has the abyss look into her. And things start to go awry when Cady begins to take her double-agent mission a little too seriously. Even as Cady attempts to destroy Regina by taking away her sources of power -- her hot body, her army of skanks and her man-candy -- Cady is falling for that very same man-candy herself, Regina's ex-boyfriend, the delectable Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett). Before long, there's a big ole cat fight brewing that takes places through vicious cold war subterfuge, pitting friend against friend, and cell phone against cell phone in an epic battle of manipulation and emotional blackmail. Tina Fey of SNL fame who adapted the screenplay from Rosalind Wiseman's book Queen Bees and Wannabes, also plays the role of Cady's hapless math teacher, Mrs. Norbury. Fey also has the unenviable job of cramming some of the self help tenets of the book into the film itself. In an extended scene in the school gymnasium, the mean girls are all forced to confront each other, apologize for their misdeeds and right wrongs by playing trust games like falling over backwards into each other's arms. This is one of the scenes where the difficulty in adapting a non-fiction book into a film are most apparent. And it's also where things begin to get oversimplified. Wiseman's book -- subtitled ""Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and other Realities of Adolescence"" -- was meant to help parents address some of the social problems that teenage girls face. Girl on girl aggression is an increasingly common problem and parents need all the help they can get it seems from Lynn Glazier's documentary It's a Girl's World, broadcast on CBC's The Passionate Eye. Glazier's documentary is billed as ""an unprecedented look inside the hidden culture of two very different girl cliques ruled by rumour, gossip and exclusion to achieve social power at any cost."" The documentary is accompanied by a three-part radio series to be broadcast on consecutive Wednesdays on May 5, 12 and 19 at 9 pm ET on CBC Radio One's"
107,ALG_Doc7_Mean_Girls,ALG_Doc7_Mean_Girls,ALG,Comedy,Negative,Mean_Girls,"Before Lindsay Lohan became as famous for her offscreen activities as for her movie performances (""The Parent Trap,"" ""Freaky Friday"") and before Tina Fey ran for the Vice Presidency of the United States (""Saturday Night Live""), the pair made ""Mean Girls"" in 2004. Lohan starred, and Fey wrote the screenplay and co-starred. The movie takes some mildly amusing shots at formula, new-girl-in-town teen films and, while breaking no new ground, at least leaves one smiling. Given its potential, I just wish it had done something more. Lohan plays Cady Heron, a sixteen-year-old whose parents have home-schooled her while traveling around the world as research zoologists. The family has just returned from an extended stay in Africa and finally settled down in middle America, so Cady is off to a regular public school for the first time in her life. She goes from the wild to the wilder. The filmmakers, basing their movie on the book ""Queen Bees and Wannabes"" by Rosalind Wiseman, intend for Cady's encounters at North Shore High School to represent and satirize most of the problems of everyday, middle-class high-school life. We get shots at name-calling, backbiting, gossiping, rumormongering, petty jealousies, and general cattiness, just for starts. If it seems as though you've seen all this before, well, yeah, you probably have. The movie's successes, minor as they may be, are in the details. On Cady's first day of school, she learns that animals of the veldt who eat each other for dinner are nicer to one another than the student body at North Shore. Practically everybody at school is a creep or a jerk. Naturally, various cliques entirely make up the student body, each clique sitting at a different table in the cafeteria. There are the jocks, the cheerleaders, the hotties, the blacks, the cool Asians, the thin girls, the fat girls, the art freaks, the band geeks, the burnouts, the wannabes, the nerds, the preps, the freshmen, the ROTC, etc. At the top of the ladder are the Plastics, the royalty of the cliques, whose leader, Regina George (Rachel McAdams), is the Queen Bee, the richest, meanest girl in school. Despite the fact that Cady is brilliant and beautiful, almost nobody wants to have anything to do with her because she doesn't belong to a clique, so the first friends she makes are a pair of outsiders like herself: Damian (Daniel Franzese), a gay, witty young man, and Janis (Lizzy Caplan), a smart, semi-goth, artsy type girl. (Nobody in the film actually looks, talks, or thinks like a teenager, neither figuratively nor literally. Lohan is about the only person in the movie who was still in her teens when she made it, and the others appear to be just what they are, twenty-somethings.) Now comes the major plot contrivance. Janis holds a grudge against Regina for spreading a rumor about her being a lesbian. When Regina and her followers take an unexpected interest in Cady, Janis and Damian urge Cady to go along with it,"

Cady's parents are biologists who set roots in South Africa. Her parents home schooled her and she socialized mostly with the local African children and with the animals her parents studied. She has led an idyllic existence and was very happy until her mother accepts a teaching position at Northwestern. So it's off to Illinois they go. Bless her heart, Cady is ill equipped to deal with the cut throat hell hole that is high school. She has never been socialized with American kids so she doesn't know the language, the music, and the clothes. This automatically puts her at a disadvantage. She finds a connection with her math teacher, Ms. Norbury (Tina Fey), but that is about it until finally two kids throw her a bone. A angry Goth girl named Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and a very gay guy named Damian (Daniel Franzese). These two happen to be outsiders, but at least she has friends. Then unexpectedly, Cady gets invited to lunch with the ""plastics"" a group of the most popular girls in school. They are rich and beautiful, but as it turns out very superficial and very mean. Janis convinces Cady to join ""the Plastics"" and find out their secrets one they know their secrets and weaknesses, they can destroy them. Cady is more than happy to oblige., but finds herself liking the prestige that comes with being a Plastic and oddly, she is starting to like then and act just like them. Can Cady step back and find her old self before too many people are harmed or before she loses herself for good? I spoke with Director Mark Waters and we had a wonderful conversation. He explained to me how he finds the female mind very interesting and that is why he as chosen to do so many movies that center around women. We talked about some of the prat falls of being a director in Hollywood. Like even though the suits (and myself for that matter) Head Over Heels loved his movie, audiences didn't find it and it bombed. Once it bombed, ""POOF"" his big budget list of possible movies went away. Never mind that they could say enough good things about his work, It was all about the green. Financially speaking, I think Mark might have the hit he needs to get the movies he wants to make greenlit by the suits. He is such a nice man that I hope it works out for him. That said, Mean Girls didn't do it for me. It reminded me of Heathers which coincidentally was written by Mark's brother Daniel. But it wasn't nearly as smart, witty, funny, or engaging as Heathers.

Trafficking unknowingly in stale teen girl flick cliches and failing to maintain a narrative flow past the hour mark, ""Mean Girls"" is a disappointment, and a poor directing job from clearly-out-of-his-league filmmaker, Mark Waters. There are laughs, but also a great deal of disinterest what the film is trying to say. After being home schooled in Africa for most of her life, Cady (Lindsay Lohan, ""Freaky Friday"") is making a fresh start in a suburban Illinois high school. Trying to fit into her treacherous surroundings, Cady makes friends with two ""art geeks"" (Daniel Franzese and Lizzy Caplan), as well as three of the most popular girls in the school, known as ""The Plastics"" (Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, and Amanda Seyfried). Torn between the friends she respects and the popularity that will bring her attention, boys, and pretty clothes, Cady is pushed to the brink when The Plastics begin to betray her. Employing the rules of the jungle to help achieve revenge, Cady attempts to keep her self-respect as she sorts out the mess she's in. What's really exciting about ""Mean Girls"" is that it was written by current ""Saturday Night Live"" savior Fey. In her first feature film screenplay, hopes were high that Fey could translate her razor wit and crack timing to the big screen, especially in the excruciatingly flooded genre of the high school clique comedy. ""Mean Girls"" is a nice idea for a film, based on the novel by Rosalind Wiseman. ""Girls"" opens as a satire of high school life, complete with broad student stereotypes and requisite weenie teachers (played by Fey and Tim Meadows). The defining material of the film is how Wiseman juxtaposes the backstabbing, ferocious high school relationships with similar ones found in the animal life of Africa, and director Mark Waters (""Freaky Friday"") covers this material exactly for the first 45 minutes. But much like Cady herself, Waters begins to fall a little too much in love with his movie, and he doesn't know when to stop. ""Mean Girls"" is only a genuinely smart, wonderful film for about a 1/3 of its running time. The rest is devoted to stale gags (the film contains another entry for the ""2004: Year of the Fart Joke"" awards) and material so depressingly familiar that it sucks all the energy out of the production by the time it reaches the hour mark, where it just simply shrivels up and dies. Most of the fault for the failure of ""Mean Girls"" can be placed on Waters's shoulders, as he is just the wrong man for this job. Fey's script is peppered with biting jabs at overindulging parents, sexualized pre-teens (a ripe topic if I ever saw one), and the awkwardness of being in high school without a defining identity.

110,ALG_Doc10_Mean_Girls,ALG_Doc10_Mean_Girls,ALG,Comedy,Negative,Mean_Girls,"Mean Girls boasts a screenplay written by the queen bee of hip comedy, Tina Fey, who used Rosalind Wiseman's parental self-help tome ""Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends & Other Realities of Adolescence"" as a reference point. Wiseman's book offers little that hasn't been covered by Jane Austen, Emily Bronte or Louisa May Alcott; mostly it describes age-old social situations in pop-psycholgical terms under the guise of candidness. All you need to know about Wiseman is that she has spent time on ""Dr. Phil"" promoting Empower, her organization that works to ""empower"" adolescent girls to proactively synergize their diverse energies into interpersonal win-win situations  a Coveyization of ""Girl World"" understanding. Ultimately, her method yields little actual insight because it's so reductive; she employs charts, graphs and tables to organize all girls into ""types"" (queen bee, sidekick, torn bystander, messenger and target), then interviews a bunch of them and plugs their comments into her analysis where handy. By simplifying humans into sub-archetypes, they become less like actual humans and more like stock movie characters. It would be a good starting point, perhaps, if the reader were unaware how treacherous adolescence can be. Fundamentally, though, it's an incomplete understanding of the complexity of human relationships that masquerades as deep analysis  Wiseman doesn't attempt to get under the skin of her subjects, like the better efforts of Rachel Simmons' ""Odd Girl Out: The Hidden Culture of Aggression in Girls"" or Mary Pipher's ""Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls."" The reality is that most high school boys and girls are acutely aware of ""types,"" and most fit bits and pieces of several. Yes, there are ""popular girls"" and ""sexually active band geeks"" and ""JV jocks,"" but the masses exist between the obvious stereotypes  the opposite of the high school movie, in which the protagonist is the only different, diverse and interesting character swimming through a sea of stereotypes. No doubt ""types"" populate our high schools, but ever since John Hughes' The Breakfast Club told us that ""You see us as you want to see us  in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions,"" this arrangement has ironically been taken for gospel. What's worse is that this theory of the high school social milieu has become the standard narrative to ""understanding"" school violence, even when the classifying of groups isn't relevant. At its best, the high school movie transcends its setting, using high school as a metaphor for something larger (think Alexander Payne's Election); mostly, though, films from this genre have become basically naive versions of Robert Altman movies. Mean Girls thrusts Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan), the new girl who was raised in Africa by missionary parents, into the sexually charged world of the suburban high school  so sexually charged, in fact, that the first thing the bespectacled math teacher (Fey herself) does is take off her spilled-upon shirt in front of the class.

111,ANM_Doc1_Batman,ANM_Doc1_Batman,ANM,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"When Tim Burton was approached to direct a Batman movie, the most ubiquitous image of the Caped Crusader in pop culture was Adam West's gloriously campy TV show from the 1960s. But by then, comics like The Dark Knight Returns and The Killing Joke had pushed back against that colorful, lighthearted portrayal of the character and gone back to the dark, gritty roots of Bob Kane and Bill Finger's original vision. Burton set out to inject some of that Frank Miller/Alan Moore grimness into the character without sacrificing any of the fun, and he couldn't have done a better job. As soon as Batman swooped into theaters in 1989, West's zany turn as the Bat was vanquished from the cultural consciousness and Michael Keaton took his place. Keaton captured all the universal truths about this character: his tortured soul, his effortless coolness, his fearlessness in the face of life-or-death stakes, and above all, the fact that billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne is the real mask he puts on, not the black cowl. Keaton's performance is full of little moments that perfectly encapsulate Bruce as a character, much like Christopher Reeve's definitive turn as Clark Kent. When Bruce is having dinner with Vicki Vale in an elegant dining hall in his lavish mansion, he tells her, ""I don't think I've ever been in this room before."" That line tells us everything we need to know about the character: he's down-to-earth, he's refreshingly frank, and he doesn't care about the frills of his riches. Burton doesn't abandon the comic-booky camp of the Adam West series entirely  the art gallery sequence set to Prince's ""Partyman"" is a perfect example of that  but he did inject a hefty dose of darkness. He reused the series' signature goofy Dutch angles, but used them more to unsettle the audience than to heighten the reality. With detectives in trench coats and gangsters in fedoras, the costumes are ripped straight out of an old-school noir. But Burton's visual style also borrows heavily from German Expressionism, with shadowy figures, a gloomy color palette, extravagant set design, and a gothic, almost steampunk vision of Gotham City. Jack Nicholson has a ton of fun with the Joker's blend of sadism and buffoonery, playing him essentially as Jack Torrance in clown makeup. He strikes the perfect middle ground between the cackling vaudevillian theatricality of Cesar Romero and Mark Hamill, and the genuine menace of Heath Ledger. The transformation scene, in which Jack Napier first sees his disfigured face in a mirror and laughs hysterically, is pure nightmare fuel. Danny Elfman's theme is as synonymous with the Bat as John Williams' Superman theme is with the Man of Steel; it captures the atmosphere of the character so perfectly that it's since been reused in everything from Batman: The Animated Series to the Lego Batman video games to Batman the Ride at Six Flags. It's not quite a flawless movie. I understand why Prince is on the soundtrack  at the height of"

That is exactly what Director Tim Burton's Batman (1989) did for the caped crusader and its impact is still being felt in the present day. As part of Loud and Clear's Tim Burton Month, I jumped at the opportunity to review this film that kicked off the superhero genre. Although I loved it as a teenager, would it still hold up? The answer is a resounding yes, with one tiny exception. Batman (1989) starts as billionaire Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton, of Beetlejuice), after witnessing the murder of his parents as a child, has recently begun his war on crime in the fictional Gotham City in the guise of Batman. He soon crosses paths with mobster Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson, of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) and their encounter leaves Napier disfigured and driven mad. As Bruce strikes up a connection with photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger, of The Natural), Napier, now referring to himself as The Joker, begins taking over Gotham's criminal underworld. Bruce must face his past before heading out in the night as Batman to put a stop to Joker's reign of terror. This narrative serves as a near complete reinvention of its title character, especially when one compares it to the version audiences were most familiar with at the time. While Burton's take on Batman still possesses some of the camp featured in the 1960s television series starring Adam West as Bruce Wayne/Batman, this film is without a doubt darker. The film's story primarily adapts the ""Red Hood"" origin for Joker, with one noticeable twist from screenwriters Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren. The pair also took inspiration for the tone of their script from comic arcs such as Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"". This story feels almost timeless, even with the inclusion of a soundtrack by Prince (which is excellent, by the way). You do not get a sense of what year or era this takes place in outside of what is needed. All you need to know is that this is Bruce Wayne's early days of being Batman. Much like any old random first issue of a comic book, you can pick this up without any prior knowledge and get lost in what is told/shown within the film. Burton, Hamm, and Skaaren create a unique version of Batman, one that instantly separates himself from the moment he appears on screen. His suit ditches the blue and gray of the 60s series for a striking yellow and black, which was then made into the character's standard comic book look for several years. They also do a great job of emphasizing the struggle of Bruce Wayne balancing being himself and Batman. This depiction and the one seen in 2022's The Batman handle this issue best and incorporate it well into Bruce's arc throughout. Keaton may not have the traditional Bruce Wayne look, but"
113,ANM_Doc3_Batman,ANM_Doc3_Batman,ANM,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"On June 23, 1989, the Dark Knight stormed into American theaters. The result? A Tim Burton blockbuster that kick-started the Batman series on film. The original Hollywood Reporter review, which praised the movie's ""surrealistic visual style,"" is below. Created 50 years ago as a comic book hero, the character of Batman has provided the basis for numerous television and film projects as well. Through the years he has evolved into a cartoon, especially in the high camp TV series of the 1960s. The dark side of the character has now been restored in the new Warner Bros. film Batman. Produced by Jon Peters and Peter Guber, this Batman is a stunning achievement, especially through the incredible and unique visualization of director Tim Burton. The film may be disappointing to those expecting a campy cartoon, however, although the more dramatic stylization of this version is its strongest asset. The screenplay by Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren (story by Hamm), based on characters created by Bob Kane for DC Comics, presents Batman as a menacing, mysterious figure and not as a hero of the people, in spite of the fact that his actions are against Gotham City's criminal elements. City officials, however, are not sure of his motives and disapprove of his vigilante approach to crime fighting. The script also explores the motivation behind the character and the psychological torment of Bruce Wayne and why he has taken on the disguise. The major strength of the film is actually its surrealistic visual style, which creates a disturbing portrait of a decaying society without structure or purpose. Production designer Anton Furst has created a Gotham City that is a dark, steaming cesspool, littered with waste and evolved as a jumble of almost every architectural style since the beginning of civilization. It is a place where it is most believable that a menace such as The Joker could seduce and possibly control the city. Contrasting this majestic visual concept is a quiet, but equally intense, human drama in which two people are trying to get together and make it in a basically hostile world. This is the uniqueness and very soul of the film and it is achieved through the beautifully defined and probing performances of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne and Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, a news photographer who is intrigued by both Wayne and Batman. Keaton delivers an especially impressive and deeply nuanced characterization as Wayne. When he takes on the Batman disguise, he becomes an enigmatic, robot-like figured without human personality. At the other end of the spectrum is Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker. It is difficult to imagine any other actor performing this character as well. And Nicholson, in white makeup with his face frozen into a menacing grimace, plays it to the hilt. The actor goes over the edge as only he can do and his performance works perfectly. Jack Palance is fun in his brief appearance as a crime czar and Michael Gough is excellent as"
114,ANM_Doc4_Batman,ANM_Doc4_Batman,ANM,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"THE STAPLE characters of comic books are usually superheroes, endowed with powers from supernatural, extra-terrestrial or mutant origins. The first and most famous, Superman, introduced dual identity the ordinary citizen who is transformed into the weirdly-attired sky-riding avenger, a Scarlet Pimpernel of the sky. Superman's strength, however, was his weakness. He was too invincible and ways had to be found of diminishing his powers to make him more interesting. Batman was devised as his stablemate in the Detective Comics magazine but given human frailties. The first issue of Batman Comics in April 1940 depicts a small boy witnessing the murder of his millionaire parents by a thief. Using his inherited wealth, he becomes a master scientist and develops an extraordinary physique. Years later he is ready to avenge his dead parents. Batman is born. The new Batman is the most intelligent film ever made from a comic book. It dispels the 1960s high-camp nonsense, with the Caped Crusader in mauve tights, battling criminals even more stupidly dressed than himself. Tim Burton's dark film sets Batman back on course as devised by Bob Kane and his writer Bill Finger in 1939. The screenwriters, Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren, appreciate that today's tastes are closer to the good versus evil issues of 1939 than the dope-blurred, ambiguous morality of 20 years ago. Hamm has even written three recent Batman Comics where the same mood prevails. Batman is essentially an adolescent fantasy. Kane and Finger were still in their teens when Detective Comics first accepted their creation of the original Batman (the film slips in a subtle acknowledgement to them by making the cartoonist on the Gotham Globe sign his work ``Bob Kane''.) Every Batman feat is allegedly within the human compass. He is vulnerable to ambush and double-cross. He bleeds. But he also comes well-equipped. About his person is the Batbelt, with weaponry and the array of Batropes that enable him to soar through the air. He has a Batwing jet aircraft which has the silhouette of the Batlogo (although its strike capability is not so hot; on its only sortie it misses the target). His Batmobile is a 20ft black behemoth, a vehicle that will answer a remote control call and seek him out like a freshly-roused dog. His Batcave is equipped with enough scientific paraphernalia to build an atom bomb. Above is Wayne Manor, the vast mansion in which he lives as the hyper-rich Bruce Wayne. Burton introduces his Batman looming from a city roof like an angel of death, striking terror on two muggers counting their loot. Their crime is almost a carbon copy of the one in which his parents were killed. The atmosphere is heavy with the smell of vengeance. So is the interpretation of the lead actor. In Beetlejuice, Michael Keaton's earlier film for Tim Burton, he was a zany, hyperactive spectre. As Batman he is restrained and sombre. Even his Bat costume is rigid and unyielding. His torso is encased in a black carapace which,"
115,ANM_Doc5_Batman,ANM_Doc5_Batman,ANM,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman,"Most live-action comic book movies fail because their two-dimensional characters are too insubstantial to stand up to the solid flesh of cinematic reality. The Salkinds' Superman series finally ran into the ground, and in the past decade older comic heroes such as Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers and The Lone Ranger have faltered in film versions. Soon Terry Gilliam will be making his film from a much newer cult comic, The Watchman. Until then Burton's Batman is the one to satisfy both the followers and those who may never have opened a comic book. The cinematic detail of the Batman sets must be credited  or maybe your bored eyes want anything worth caring about. Massive grosses propelled director Tim Burton's goth-kilter sensibility into the mainstream, but there are long dull minutes that don't seem Burton-y at all. The director made this Batman between Beetlejuice (1988) and Edward Scissorhands (1990), a live-action cartoon of twisted delight. Making this was miserable. He was an art school kid among alpha dogs. Who deserves credit for the film's manic mood? I count four men with as much authorship claim as Burton. Nicholson was the resident legend, outranking Batman in the opening credits, and he dominates the camera's frame. Production designer Anton Furst made Gotham a magnificent ruin, so much Art Deco decomposing, all those piping and vents that look eerily biological. (It's an innards city.) Composer Danny Elfman's merry melodies move because Batman barely can. Freeze frames in the establishing shots while listening to the score, and you almost see the film Burton wanted to make, and later did. Don't forget ravenous producer Jon Peters, who wanted the star power of Keaton and Nicholson: they improvised dialogue with Burton, while the production went over budget. As recounted in the 1996 Nancy Griffin and Kim Masters' Hit & Run: How Jon Peters and Peter Guber Took Sony for a Ride in Hollywood (Simon & Schuster), Peters dated Basinger during the production. He claimed the two of them co-wrote the third act  which sounds like an empty credit grab, but why would anyone brag about writing this third act? An early shot speaks volumes. Bruce ditches a gala at his manor to sit in front of a bank of screens, watching his guests from far away. He looks like a security guard who prefers night shifts  or a moody director. Keaton is great in these quiet moments, when the script's not asking him to juggle yuppie cuteness and gruff intimidation. He is the Bemused Batman  and is that furrowed brow channeling his Beetlejuice director's own frustrations? A tone of hesitation comes through in dialogue. ""This house and all this stuff,"" Vicki tells Bruce, ""It really doesn't seem like you at all."" Later, Bruce has to explain Batman-ness, and what he says is: ""Look, sometimes I don't even know what to think about this. It's just something I have to do.""

It's a shame something more memorable doesn't happen there. ""Batman"" is a triumph of design over story, style over substance  a great-looking movie with a plot you can't care much about. All of the big moments in the movie are pounded home with ear-shattering sound effects and a jackhammer cutting style, but that just serves to underline the movie's problem, which is a curious lack of suspense and intrinsic interest. ""Batman"" discards the recent cultural history of the Batman character  the camp 1960s TV series, the in-joke comic books  and returns to the mood of the 1940s, the decade of film noir and fascism. The movie is set at the present moment, more or less, but looks as if little has happened in architecture or city planning since the classic DC comic books created that architectural style you could call Comic Book Moderne. The streets of Gotham City are lined with bizarre skyscrapers that climb cancerously toward the sky, held up (or apart) by sky bridges and stresswork that look like webs against the night sky. At street level, gray and anonymous people scurry fearfully through the shadows, and the city cancels its 200th anniversary celebration because the streets are not safe enough to hold it. Gotham is in the midst of a wave of crime and murder orchestrated by The Joker (Jack Nicholson), and civilization is defended only by Batman (Michael Keaton). The screenplay takes a bow in the direction of the origin of the Batman story (young Bruce Wayne saw his parents murdered by a thug and vowed to use their fortune to dedicate his life to crime-fighting), and it also explains how The Joker got his fearsome grimace. Then it turns into a gloomy showdown between the two bizarre characters. Nicholson's Joker is really the most important character in the movie  in impact and screen time  and Keaton's Batman and Bruce Wayne characters are so monosyllabic and impenetrable that we have to remind ourselves to cheer for them. Kim Basinger strides in as Vicky Vale, a famous photographer assigned to the Gotham City crime wave, but although she and Wayne carry on a courtship and Batman rescues her from certain death more than once, there's no chemistry and little eroticism. The strangest scene in the movie may be the one where Vicky is brought into the Batcave by Alfred, the faithful valet, and realizes for the first time that Bruce Wayne and Batman are the same person. How does she react? She doesn't react. The movie forgets to allow her to be astonished. Remembering the movie, I find that the visuals remain strong in my mind, but I have trouble caring about what happened in front of them. I remember an astonishing special effects shot that travels up, up to the penthouse of a towering, ugly skyscraper, and I remember the armor"
117,ANM_Doc7_Batman,ANM_Doc7_Batman,ANM,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"Jack Nicholson's name appears first in the credits, and for good reason. It may be called Batman, but this is The Joker's movie. It's unsurprising, I suppose, that director Tim Burton, working from a script by Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren, would be most interested in the freakiest character from the Bob Kane comic. Considering Pee-Wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice, it makes sense that he would be drawn to the tale's biggest wacko. And with Nicholson in the role, why not go in that direction? Not all of the creative choices work  there's no reason The Joker should be dancing to Prince  yet not for lack of effort on the actor's part. Nicholson goes for it in Batman, reputation be damned. His commitment pays off exponentially, as we get BIG, overacting Jack at the start, which sets the stage for the GARGANTUAN Jack we get later, as The Joker travels further and further into the deep end. (Incidentally, I love the early scene in which Jack Palance, as crime boss Carl Grissom, basically does a Nicholson impersonation to Nicholson's face. And then the way Nicholson himself later calls back to that in an ironically dramatic speech to one of his henchman.) Nicholson isn't only offering a brilliant bit of self-parody here, he's doing it in service to the character. And so Batman is only partly the tale of Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne, a vigilante millionaire scarred from having witnessed his parents' murders as a child. The movie is mostly the saga of Jack Napier, a lifelong delinquent scarred  psychologically and physically  from being dropped into a vat of gurgling green chemicals. How did Burton get away with this shift in focus? By casting Nicholson, yes, but also by framing Batman as a story of mirror identities. Wayne and Napier are both broken, yet each has responded to that brokenness in a different way. If Napier has embraced the madness to its logical conclusion  chaos  Wayne has attempted to compartmentalize it into an alter ego that's ostensibly meant to keep chaos at bay. All of which means that Keaton is equally crucial. Even given Keaton's earlier collaboration with Burton on Beetlejuice, he was still an unconventional choice for a superhero action movie. Good thing this isn't a superhero action movie (in fact, the action is its weak spot) but rather a psychological dark comedy, something at which Keaton excels. There's a wonderful scene early on, in which Wayne eavesdrops on Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl) and Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) as they tour the weapons room of his mansion, making jokes about his collection. Wayne softly chuckles at the jokes too, which suggests he's a man who's able to regard himself outside of himself. A man with a split personality. The scenes with Keaton and Nicholson together, however, are where this identity theme really sings. My favorite confrontation may be the one involving the least amount of gadgets and costumes, in Vicki Vale's apartment. Wayne is"
118,ANM_Doc8_Batman,ANM_Doc8_Batman,ANM,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman,"People are still complaining about the idea of Ben Affleck as Batman. But, based on the trailers alone, and a few released still images, it's already obvious that, even at its worst, the new Batman and Superman movie can't be worse than what has come before it. Batman has bottomed out plenty of times before, but nothing is worse than the 1989 feature film adaptation, directed by Tim Burton and starring Michael Keaton. It does not matter what Ben Affleck does or does not do. Nothing is worse than what has already happened. The only reason that this is one of the minor flaws in this film is because Jim Gordon is made into such a completely irrelevant character. They took one of the most important aspects of the Batman myth and made him into a bumbling, slapstickish cartoon police chief. If Burton had treated his source material with more respect, Gordon wouldn't be such an irrelevant character. Commissioner Gordon is one of the first two characters in Batman, ever. He and Bruce Wayne appear on the very first page of Detective Comics #27 together. He has a major role in every great Batman comic and graphic novel of all time. Instead, he is made into an incompetent joke who you probably don't even recall being in Burton's Batman. I understand that the ""Batman doesn't kill"" rule hasn't been around forever. In the first few comic books in which he appeared, he cavalierly snapped necks and shrugged when villains died. But by the time the 1989 Batman film was made, Batman had become staunch in his refusal to kill. His character spent the majority of his time in Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns musing over the death of Jason Todd and wondering if it could ever justify killing the Joker in return... which he did not do. Then, in Batman, it never seems to even cross his mind that he doesn't kill people. Quoting Burton: ""I was never a giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan  and I think it started when I was a child  is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't know if it was dyslexia or whatever, but that's why I loved The Killing Joke, because for the first time I could tell which one to read."" At this point, its important to tell you that The Killing Joke, despite being written by genius Alan Moore, is considered by most to be a bad Batman narrative, and considered by Alan Moore to be Alan Moore's worst work. The character of The Joker, like a lot of characters in Burton's films, is not a real character. He changes from scene to scene, with no defining characteristics. The only really clear thing about him is that he is pining after the same woman as Bruce Wayne AND Batman. Worst of all, we"
119,ANM_Doc9_Batman,ANM_Doc9_Batman,ANM,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman,"Tim Burton's generally well-regarded 1989 Batman, starring Jack Nicholson as the Joker and Michael Keaton as Batman (in that order), set the stage for a franchise that ran four films, with three Batmans and two directors, before collapsing under its own weight. Unquestionably, the series degenerated with each installment before arriving at the abomination that is Joel Schumacher's Batman and Robin  yet the seeds of its demise were sown in the very first film. Critics adored Batman for its eccentric, Burtonesque take on a pop-culture icon, for its moody, noirish gothic art-deco Gotham City, and of course for Nicholson's showy performance. Comic-book fans, meanwhile, appreciated the film for rescuing the Dark Knight from the over-the-top camp comedy of the 1960s series and making him suitably dark and brooding. For all that, though, the film's flaws are hard to overlook. The story is a mess. To start with, the love affair of Bruce Wayne (Keaton) and Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) has no substance or emotional resonance. Bruce and faithful butler Alfred (Michael Gough) are constantly reminding one another how ""special"" Vicki supposedly is, though she's done little to show it, unless you count sleeping with Bruce after their awkward first date. (Peter Parker and Mary Jane's romance in the original Spider-Man is also shallow, but at least MJ is sweet and Peter is credibly smitten. Bruce and Vicki have no chemistry as well as no relationship.) Scenes and lines of dialogue make no sense. Take the bit where Bruce Wayne, protected only by a small metal tray under his shirt, gets jiggy with the gun-wielding Joker when the latter bursts in on Vicki's apartment. Forget the absurdity of relying on a book-sized tray as a bulletproof vest  what's the point of Bruce's actions? What's he trying to accomplish? What's the point of the Joker's ""Who do you trust?"" PR campaign against Batman, as if the two of them were running for mayor? This theme makes sense when it recurs in the Burton-directed sequel, Batman Returns, where the Penguin (Danny DeVito) really is running for mayor, but in the original it feels like a private issue of Burton's that's been imposed on the story for no reason. (That the Joker is crazy is not a sufficient explanation. As depicted in this film, the Joker is an ""artist""; he may be bizarre and sociopathic, but his actions are never simply irrational or pointless.) Then there are sloppy little things. When Bruce asks Vicki on their first date whether she had ""any trouble finding the place,"" it's meant to be funny because Wayne Manor is presumably a major Gotham landmark  but the movie seems to have forgotten that Vicki was just at his place for the big cocktail party. Then there's the bit in the newsroom with Vicki and reporter Knox (Robert Wuhl) musing about who Bruce Wayne really is, how there's ""nothing in his file... no photos, no history, nothing."" Hello? Nothing on Bruce Wayne, millionaire playboy? That's like saying"

There's plenty there, for sure, but for a movie so purportedly big, Batman is disconcertingly small, conceptually and visually, as if Burton's own input was deliberately siphoned off lest the end vision be too unique to trust with such potential blockbuster revenue at stake. Whether executive pressure or the sheer intimidation of the production put the squeeze on Burton, the end result has always been one of supreme apathy to these eyes, both in its lack of stylistic fervor and in the impression left on the heart and soul; the film screams out for an expressionistic wallop of action, romance, and fright, but finds only a void of underdeveloped style and halfhearted execution to call its own, as if rushed to completion without a moment's glance at the dailies along the way. A feature-length nip and tuck, it suggests  among other things  a film edited so as to squeeze in as many showings per day as possible. The beast isn't quite soulless, but the flashes of euphoria are so few and far between that it may as well be, if only to put an end to its own misery. At their best, Burton's films are not unlike miniature universes unto themselves, clearly defined spaces populated as much with people as with teeming feelings and ideas manifest within the visual sphere. This alone would make him a prime choice to breathe life into the world of the Dark Knight, but being loosely cobbled together with matte paintings, poorly shot miniatures and scrunched together sets, Batman's Gotham City feels less like a genuine setting or character than it does a half-hearted production design. The detail work is there but there's no connective thread running throughout the picture, no point of reference by which these characters exist within their cinematic realm. Cutting immediately from the opening wide shot of the cityscape to the ground level of urban decay, Burton fails to grasp the largeness of Gotham, both physically and spiritually; the landscape wants for a sense of placement within and between its scantly established locales (one imagines how much of the budget that went to securing star power would have been better spent producing a more encompassing vision of Batman's world). Ultimately, it's Blade Runner for tykes, as the film falls back on preschool conceptions of film noir to suggest the city's sickly moral infestations. From the grizzled, crooked cop who appears ready to die via heart attack at any moment to the shrieking, faceless henchman trained in martial arts by way of Saturday morning cartoons, Batman trades in extreme caricatures played straight, a relative flaw that may have proven otherwise were the film more substantially concerned with its character's supposedly weighty psychological foreplay.

This was an adaptation of (half of) a beloved book, following in the footsteps of a so-so yet affectionately remembered TV movie, leaning heavily into the never-ending wave of 1980s nostalgia. It all seemed a little safe, never completely its own entity. Yet it overcame this. As Amblin-lite as it was, It starred a winning cast of kids and went to town with classic Stephen King explorations of domestic trauma. And while never totally terrifying, it boasted a boogeyman for the ages, Bill Skarsgard wearing Pennywise like a second skin. A horror with heart, It stormed the cinema gates, and the novel's second timeline, featuring the Losers grown up and back on the clown-conquering beat, was aggressively greenlit. And now, director Andy Muschietti's shackles are off. It Chapter Two is all about crutches. A quick recap of the first film's epilogue is followed by some voiceover from the adult Mike (Mustafa). ""Sometimes, we are what we wish we could forget,"" he says. Mike has remained in Derry, but in the 27 years since, the rest of the Losers have split, none of them in touch with each other, all having moved on. In some ways, at least. The adult Losers get great intros, Muschietti and screenwriter Gary Dauberman presenting distinct personalities in precise sequences: having been out of contact for three decades, Mike, obsessed with events throughout, telephones them all with grim news from Derry, resulting in puking, car-crashing and all-round panic. From Bill Hader's Richie, now professionally wisecracking on comedy stages, to Jessica Chastain's Beverly, still sadly suffering abuse, to James McAvoy's sensitive screenwriter Bill, the success of every re-casting is immediately apparent  all of these characters feel instantly lived-in, vibrant, authentic human beings who you buy from the off. But there the comfort ends. Before we reunite with the Losers, the film itself begins in Derry with a brutal, bone-crunching homophobic attack. More disturbing than anything in chapter one, it announces at once that Muschietti is not playing it safe at all. It is decidedly adult territory, enormously troubling to witness, let alone when it's married to an even more gruesome, otherworldly coda. This opening does everything horror should do, leaving you shaken mere minutes after the film has begun. Muschietti more-or-less keeps this going throughout its near three-hour runtime. Genre-wise, Chapter Two delights in itself, just as the book did. King conceived It as a ""final exam on horror"", throwing in all the monsters people were afraid of when he was growing up. Muschietti seems equally in debt to decades of cinematic horror, 1970s and 1980s films being particular influences. There are exquisitely executed scares with the various ghouls, from unsettling background spine-chillers to full-force frightmares. It is both classy and disgusting, the creature design wonderfully inventive, all in the service of scaring you. These, though, are the sideshows. Mere supporting acts for a"

Despite having a (completely normal) fear of clowns and a general hatred of horror films that feature children, I loved the R-rated/supernatural horror meets The Goonies vibes It had. Since then, I've been equal parts looking forward to and dreading seeing the sequel. It Chapter Two picks up 27 years after its predecessor and introduces us to the grown-up version of the Losers Club. Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) is the only member of the group that has stayed in Derry. His self-appointed mission is to keep an eye on things and call his friends home when he is certain Pennywise has returned. The Losers reunite and join forces to try and defeat Pennywise for good. I am still torn whether or not I enjoyed this movie. I think it's a worthy conclusion to the first film, but it disturbed me more than any horror movie has in a long time. It wasn't your average scary movie filled with jump scares and gore. It Chapter Two had a masterful balance of building tension, making you dread what was coming, then hitting hard with a jump scare or extended terrifying scene. It left images in my head that lingered hours after watching the film. (I can never eat another fortune cookie) Once scene in particular that stuck with me was the funhouse mirror maze sequence. It's partially featured in a few of the trailers, I don't want to give anything away, but it's intense. The film also starts with a brutal controversial scene that is causing a lot of debate. Again, I won't spoil it, but it's the second chapter of the book, and its purpose is to demonstrate how the entire town of Derry is affected by Pennywise's presence. The locals are unnaturally indifferent to racism, homophobia, missing children, etc. Which leads to one of my biggest complaints about the films. Without multiple viewings or reading the book, it's easy to miss this affliction on the town of Derry and I consider it to be an important element to Pennywise's character and the development of the members of the Losers Club. Another common negative I'm hearing about the film is its runtime. It's just under three hours long, but I didn't feel the film dragged or felt long at all until the final showdown with Pennywise. Even with the almost three-hour runtime, I felt like some of the needed backstory was left out. We get hints at important character details, what's happened since the first film (especially Richie's character), but it still leaves many questions unanswered. There were a lot of great things about It Chapter Two. The casting for this film was phenomenal. It was easy to identify which child actor from the first film each adult actor was portraying. Bonus points and all the awards to whoever made the final casting decision on Richie (Finn Wolfhard/Bill Hader), Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor/Jay"

Pop culture's obsession with the painted jester has often seemed sinister, but back in 2016, something changed. A new craze had swept the world, with countless sightings of people dressed up as killer clowns, sometimes brandishing weapons and threatening passers-by. In California, one woman reported that a clown tried to snatch her baby daughter from her arms, while another man in Texas shared CCTV footage of a red-nosed prankster breaking into his home at night. They were crazy, unreal times. Enter It  the big-screen adaptation of Stephen King's classic 1986 novel. Largely indebted to the iconic '90s TV two-parter, It was a box office smash, traumatising a new generation of horror fans while raking in more money than ever before. The inevitable sequel was soon confirmed, It Chapter Two. But with two years to get over the fad and new movie Joker stealing all the headlines, has Pennywise let rip that throaty cackle for the last time? Set 27 years after the events of It, It Chapter Two finds the gang getting on with their lives. Most notably, Bill writes bestselling novels and funnyman Richie is now a famous comedian. The Losers' Club may have outgrown its moniker, but each character is haunted by their past. Eddie's new wife resembles his overbearing mother, Beverly's husband is a copy of her abusive father and now-hunky Ben can't escape his formative years as a chubby target for bullies. Eventually, a devastating phone call threatens to pull them back to Derry where Pennywise awaits. Played by Bill Skarsgard, the clown prince of mime is on top form here. Stuffed with deliciously creepy scenes, the film's mid-section follows each character as they revisit their most terrifying encounters with Pennywise. By the time we reach the epic climax, we've met baby-faced crab-wasps, mouldy decapitated heads which sing in a fish tank and a dead friend's noggin suspended by huge, furry spider's legs. Director Andres Muschietti has been given full license to spook in this sequel  and It Chapter Two works best in its weirdest, most off-the-wall moments. Elsewhere, it's a smorgasbord of genres, packing in nods to history's greatest slasher, psychological, gross-out and zombie horrors. Love The Shining? You'll want to pay attention. There's even a hilarious Stephen King cameo, where the world's scariest writer plays a sassy antiques dealer in a Neil Young t-shirt. It's a horror nut's dream. Cast-wise, the film's famous stars don't always live up to their reputations. James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain are fine individually, but Bill and Beverly share little chemistry. At the same time, Isaiah Mustafa is unconvincing as Mike and James Ransome's quirky take on hypochondriac Eddie sometimes feels like an impression. Fortunately, none of this matters because Bill Hader is a revelation. Funny, compelling and often moving, the Superbad star steals every scene he's in  which is most of them. When Hader's on screen, the movie zips along with a levity that's missing in the drawn-out opening."

The Losers Club, the most lovable group of misfits there is, has since grown up and left the sleepy town, but the evil hasn't. They are called back into action by Mike Hanlon, who remained as the town's librarian. It has returned, and it wants the Losers. This time, they have to kill It for good. Andy Muschietti's It Chapter One was a bit of a sleeper hit. It became the highest grossing horror film of all-time that no-one saw coming, because everyone hates sequels and reboots. But Muschietti had all the right ingredients to make his reboot work; a great cast and understanding that Stephen King's 'unfilmable' gigantic novel is actually about friendship, and the pain of growing up, rather than the killer clown everyone remembers the original miniseries for. Muschietti returns to the director's chair to craft a sequel that goes bigger and bolder in every sense, while digging deep into It's mythology, and the dynamic between the adult Losers. It's a mixed bag, and not everything works quite as smoothly as it did the first time. Muschietti also relies too much on CGI for scares and monsters, but in the end he regains a steady hand to bring the story to a satisfying, and a surprisingly emotional, close. As predicted, the cast is impeccable. It says a lot when James McAvoy is somehow the least charismatic onscreen presence; that's how stacked and good this cast is. McAvoy isn't bad per se, he's just left in the shadow of other equally talented actors. Especially good are Bill Hader and James Ransone as Richie and Eddie. The forever bickering friends steal the show, and every scene they are in. Hader is a revelation here, turning in one of the best performances of his career. He's laughout-loud funny, but his performance is always grounded in tragedy and selfhatred. Ransone gets possibly the flashiest role as the germaphobic Eddie. He gets to have the most fun but make no mistake, there's a lot bubbling under the surface. Eddie's insecurity, while at times played for laughs, is a tragic thing and the character's arc might just be the best of the film, along with Richie's. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJaRuD5u-4 Jessica Chastain is great as Beverly but doesn't leave much of a mark, much like McAvoy. Both seem to be on autopilot, which still produces good performances, but forgettable ones. Jay Ryan, a relatively unknown Australian actor, makes a great Ben Hanscom, especially when he's pining for Beverly. But unfortunately the character is often just a root for fat jokes. Partly this is due to the source material, but considering it's 2019, one would hope Muschietti would have handled it with more grace and sensitivity. Muschietti certainly has a particular style of CGI he prefers,the overly fake look, and long, wonky faces. There's no effort to make It's iterations look realistic, but it's a strange choice, and one that distances the viewer"

It Chapter Two Synopsis If you would like to be reminded of the first chapter of this series which is also directed by Andy Muschietti, check out our review from last week, where we go over the whole first chapter. It Chapter Two picks up 27 years later and details the lives of the kids turned adults from the first movie. As a quick recap, our character list is: Bev  The girl in the group played by Jessica Chastain Ben  The fat boy/new kid turned CEO hunk played by Jay Ryan Bill  Stutterer turned author played by James McAvoy Rich  Biting wit who wears glasses turned Comedian played by Bill Hader Mike  Token black kid who stayed in Derry played by Isaiah Mustafa Eddie  Munchausen by proxy kid turned Munchausen by proxy adult played by James Ransone Stan  Feeble Jewish kid turned feeble Jewish adult played by Andy Bean Mike, has begun to notice nefarious happenings in Derry and as you might guess, it's been 27 years since the Loser's Club made their pact to fight It if it ever came back. Mike sends the call out to all of his long-lost friends, and they respond with dread, but come home anyway. The Loser's Club has a cloud of forgetfulness that has descended upon them in the time since their Derry days, and Mike, being the only member to stay in Derry has to help them recall what happened and how they can beat it. As the Loser's Club sets out on Derry, they are reminded of the reason they left, the clown, the fear, and the life they left behind. It Chapter Two Movie Review It Chapter Two is similar enough to the first movie that you can rely on many of the same things that worked. The intense subject matter, your mom jokes, and the camaraderie are all there. We even get the kids cast back for a bounty of flashbacks and memories. It also has a hefty bag of very effective scares, that are less frequent, but more potent. Where It Chapter Two differs is the length and interesting subject matter. At 2h 49min, It Chapter Two is more than a half-hour longer than the first entry. I've never been a fan of long movies because at the 2h 30min mark I just feel like any reasonable story can fit everything and the kitchen sink in there. My mind wandered multiple times through the emotion-driven dialog, and it was a bit boring. I wasn't a big fan of the action-laden ending either. That being said, this is a solid horror movie that may be one of the most successful franchises ever, and it's not without good reason. The cast, acting, direction,"

The second half of Stephen King's horror bestseller about the terrifying clown (is there any other kind?) has now been adapted as a separate but frankly laborious film to follow the first one. That was the story of how a bunch of middle-school kids in a small American town in the 1980s banded together to defeat a homicidal harlequin of hell called Pennywise. His relationship to them made him an antichrist version of ET. Now, almost 30 years later, they are all grown up and must return to their home town to face the horrible Pennywise all over again  as adults. Screenwriter Guy Dauberman (who worked on The Conjuring franchise) adapts the second half of King's novel and the director once again is Andy Muschietti. There is some lively stuff here, including a few sensational cameos and interesting ideas about confronting one's personal demons, about homophobia, abuse and depression. It is also about the ubiquitous availability of the past in the digital age and the permanent reunion-stalkerthon of social media, and about the way guilt and shame are built into what we choose to remember and forget about our teenage years. But, like the first film, it becomes a virtual non-narrative anthology of standard jump-scares that could be reshuffled and shown in any order. The second time around, your tolerance for this is tested to destruction and beyond because, unlike the first movie, it is just so pointlessly long: approaching three hours, with our heroes finally beginning to assume a glassy-eyed solemnity like Hogwarts graduates or the Fellowship of the Ring. Muschietti is even hinting at a possible third chapter. The way they battle Pennywise as grownups is not much different from the way they did it as kids (although, arguably, these new confrontations are unlocking painful childhood memories) and Chapter Two seems to consist of an indefinite number of big, scary set pieces, featuring interchangeable snaggle-toothed creatures, or occasionally gigantic, fairground-sized monsters lurching grotesquely up out of nowhere. The scenes deliver reasonably efficient scares, but with the tension level repeatedly and disconcertingly reset afterwards to zero: the scenes don't develop or accumulate anything within a story arc and it feels as if the movie is jumping the shark and jumping back again, increasingly spending more and more time the wrong side of the shark and finally staying there. The situation is that Pennywise (played again by Bill Skarsgard) mysteriously returns to the little town of Derry, Maine, metaphysically reconfigured or reincarnated, perhaps, by an ugly display of homophobic abuse  an interesting acting cameo here for the Canadian director Xavier Dolan. Mike (played now by Isaiah Mustafa) is the only one of the gang to have stayed behind in Derry, and he gets in touch with everyone. Smart, flame-haired Bev is now a well-off professional played by Jessica Chastain, with troubles in her private life that chillingly mirror what she endured as a child; nerdy bespectacled Richie (Bill Hader) is a wisecracking standup comic; Ben (Jay"

More epic in both scope and length than its predecessor (the running time outstrips even Tarantino's ultra-indulgent Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), Andy Muschietti's good-looking sequel has visual style to spare as it pits its now-adult antiheroes against an ever-expanding creepshow of shrieking scary monsters and crawly super creeps. From giant, drooling clowns to grotesque insect apparitions and spiderlike shape-shifters, It Chapter Two doesn't skimp on the funhouse theatrics, even riffing on a quotable moment from John Carpenter's The Thing, which remains a monstrous benchmark for mind-bending 80s horror. Yet in stretching its canvas so far, the film also bursts the balloon-like charm of its predecessor, throwing more at the audience while ultimately landing less of an engaging emotional punch. Twenty-seven years after the Goonies-inflected adventures of the first film, the former members of the Losers' Club from Derry, Maine (now played by a new, grownup cast), have gone their separate ways, all but forgetting the oath they swore about their ghoulish childhood nemesis: ""If it ever comes back, we'll come back too."" Each has their own life, although the past still haunts them. Bill (James McAvoy) is a popular writer who has a problem with endings; Beverly (Jessica Chastain) has swapped an abusive father for an equally toxic husband; Ben (Jay Ryan) is still lovelorn despite remodelling himself as a ripped success story; Eddie (James Ransone) has retreated into risk assessment; Richie (Bill Hader) has funnelled his insecurities into standup comedy; and Stanley (Andy Bean) lives in terror of his childhood nightmare returning. Only Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) has stayed in Derry, awaiting an echo of former horrors that will call his comrades to ""come home, come home"". Things start promisingly with a nostalgic roundup that reunites the old gang in a Chinese restaurant, laying the table for what is to come. An encounter with devilish fortune cookies soon mutates into a shiversome set piece, the palpable chills of which are promptly undercut by a reassuring pay-off gag (""Can we get the check?""). This is a recurrent trope: whenever fear rears its ugly head, humour is swiftly deployed to rebalance the upbeat atmosphere, undercutting any genuine sense of dread. The titular beast may feed on fright, but this movie (like its predecessor) doesn't really want to scare us beyond delivering the odd jolt. For all its dark secrets (repressed guilt, violent homophobia, post-traumatic amnesia) and visions of sewers full of dead children, the film retains a mainstream popcorn sensibility, as carnivalesque as Derry's festival fairground. Nods to horror classics abound, from the ripped shower curtain of Psycho to the ""Here's Johnny!"" refrain from The Shining, but once again it's the family-friendly fantasies of Steven Spielberg that cast the longest shadow.

For nearly three hours, the epic-sized sequel It Chapter Two attempts to mirror the length and girth of Stephen King's massive 1986 novel of 1,138 pages, one of the author's longest and most memorable works. After the incredible financial success of the first big-screen adaptation of It in 2017, which earned over $300 million in domestic receipts and even more at the international box office, the sequel attempts to instill its own landmark quality with a long runtime. But director Andy Muschietti's unsophisticated treatment of the beloved pop-horror text fails to elevate the material to the exultant stature implied by its duration. As an author, King validated an admittedly ludicrous storyabout adults grappling with horrific memories from their childhood experiences fighting an alien-clown named Pennywisewith his ability to immerse the reader in the inner psychology of his characters. Muschietti prefers to jolt his audience with cheap jump-scares, an ear-pummeling score, and gooey special FX more attuned to lowbrow schlock. At the same time, his characters, performed by an excellent cast, feel peripheral to the movie's spooky funhouse scares. Despite the luxurious 170-minute runtime, Chapter Two feels hastily assembled, oddly brief and bloated at the same time, and beneath the text on which it was based. Set 27 years after the events of its predecessor, Chapter Two opens with Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) having returned from his slumber in the bowels of Derry, Maine, where the Losers Club of reject teens once assembled to stop him. The adult Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) has never left Derry and thus has never forgotten his traumatic experiences fighting the child-murdering clown. In fact, he's spent nearly three decades at the local library, researching Derry's storied history to uncover a way to defeat Pennywise once and for all. This is all recounted for the viewer in Mike's banal voiceover, wrought with winking lines such as, ""Sometimes they come back"" (the name of a King short story). Eventually, Mike calls upon his former friends, who made a blood oath as teens, to reassemble in Derry should the creature ever return. Strangely enough, those who left their childhood town have forgotten what happened, meaning much of Chapter Two involves scenes that recall events from Chapter One. Then again, the sequel also entails the characters remembering new scenes from their childhood that the filmmakers couldn't fit in the 2017 movie. When Mike calls his friends to ask them to come home, Muschietti has fun reintroducing his audience to the adult version of the Losers Club. The stuttering former leader of their group, Bill (James McAvoy), has become a successful novelist who now toils in Hollywood under a fretting director (Peter Bogdanovich). Though he replaced his overprotective mother with an equally fussy wife, the hypochondriacal Eddie (James Ransone) has found his calling as an insurance risk assessor. Likewise, Bev (Jessica Chastain) runs a successful fashion business, but she has replaced her abusive father with a marriage marked by domestic violence.

I spent much of the movie's almost three-hour runtime staring at the screen in both fascination and puzzlement. More than 24 hours after seeing it, I still can't stop turning it over in my head. Two years after launching the highest-grossing horror movie of all timeand teeing up for an absolute corker of a sequelthis, of all things, is what they came up with? Even in its strongest moments, It Chapter Two is a mess of a moviean overlong, incoherently plotted, tonally confused, and undeservedly sentimental movie that seems destined to alienate the audience that turned up so eagerly for Chapter One. This is a sequel that is both much less frightening and much weirder than audiences have been primed to expect. Let's recap. It is the story of a group of kids from Derry, Maine who discover that their hometown is beset by a mysterious evil, which they call ""It."" It can shapeshift into pretty much anything, but generally appears as a creepy clown called Pennywise. It feeds on fear, and specifically targets children, reemerging for another hunt on a 27-year feeding cycle. In 2017's Chapter One, which was set in 1989, the kids subdued It but didn't manage to kill it. Chapter Two, which is set in 2016, revisits the same kids as troubled adults who reluctantly return to Derry to finish the job Stephen King's original novel, which clocks in at well over 1,000 pages, presented a unique challenge for filmmakers: There's simply so much story in It that it's impossible to squeeze it all in. The new movies solved that problem by splitting the story in two; while King bounced back between the two timelines throughout the novel, It spent a whole movie on just the kids before revisiting them 27 years later for the sequel. For a pair of theatrical movies, that compromise was probably necessarybut while the choice led to a uniquely focused and claustrophobic Chapter One, it puts Chapter Two at a disadvantage. Where the original could zoom in on the horrors of a troubled childhood, the new movie has to (1) reintroduce all seven main characters, (2) get the audience up to speed on what's happened to them over the past 27 years, (3) bring them all back together again, and (4) send them off on a new mission to kill It once and for all. There are also a slew of flashbacks: a weird mix of scenes you'll remember from Chapter One, deleted Chapter One scenes that have been reconfigured, and newly-shot scenes that add context but stretch the already convoluted continuity to the breaking point. No wonder Chapter Two clocks in at nearly three hours. It feels every second of it. But the length wouldn't necessarily be a problem if Chapter Two had a stronger command of tone, or a clearer sense of what it was doing with its location or its characters. The most baffling thing"

Knowing the possibility that he could return in 27 years, the group vows to come back to Derry if Pennywise every resurfaces. If that doesn't scream sequel nothing does. To be fair Stephen King's best-selling novel made a clear that a sequel was all but guaranteed. And it's not like the filmmakers weren't saying as much before the first ""It"" even hit theaters. And I'm sure Warner Bros. didn't mind making another film considering the first one brought in over $700 million against a modest $35 million budget. ""It: Chapter Two"" deals with the inevitable return of Pennywise after 27 years in hibernation. A new cast plays the all grown up ""Losers"" while the original cast returns playing their younger selves in numerous flashbacks. Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) ends up being the only one who stayed in Derry and when he sees signs of the killer clown's return he contacts the ""Losers"" to fulfill their oath. Strangely, with the exception of Mike, the group have forgotten key details of their friendship and their time in Derry. Turns out the further you get away from the town the less you remember. Bill (James McAvoy), Beverly (Jessica Chastain), Richie (Bill Hader), Ben (Jay Ryan), Eddie (James Ransone), and Stanley (Andy Bean) receive calls from Mike beginning their slow drip of returning memories. It also begins the film's overly long and cumbersome task of getting these characters from Point A to Point B while checking off a lot of boxes along the way. Navigating the unwieldy plot is just one of the problems effecting this overstuffed and wildly uneven sequel. The first film proved that these characters were at their best when they were together. ""Chapter Two"" fails to tap into that by keeping them apart for far too long. Take a long middle segment where each person goes out on their own to find their ""artifact"" hidden somewhere in Derry. It's meant to show them facing and overcoming a buried fear from their past, but it plays out like one staged horror set piece after another some. A couple are good including Beverly's despite it being completely spoiled in the trailers. Some are more interested in the grotesque while others are just ridiculous. A couple of moments do hit home particularly when the group discovers their old underground clubhouse. The scene blends together sequences of the young and old in a way that makes their friendships seem authentic and tangible. There is also a tender emotional tug from the movie's final few minutes that you can't help but be effected by despite the bumpy road to get there. A few other things contribute to this disappointing followup. Several aimless story-threads are introduced that literally go nowhere. There is a fizzling love triangle that is all but abandoned.

I squirm and moan my way through stinkers all the time, but I can't actually remember the last time I saw a submental farce this witless, boring and stupid. Because the stars are Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum and Daniel Radcliffe, with an inside-joke cameo by Brad Pitt in a long blonde wig, the appeal for audiences with low standards and no knowledge of (or interest in) genuine comedy timing is guaranteed. But nobody in this comic-book twaddle displays any talent for farce, and it is doubtful that either of the two directors, Adam and Aaron Nee, could successfully stage the baking of a batch of Girl Scout cookies. They also wrote the screenplay, which sounds like it was dictated by baboons on tranquilizers. Two other so-called writers, Oren Uziel and Dana Fox, are also credited. I'm curious which one forced Sandra Bullock to deliver a two-page monologue to Channing Tatum's penis. No point in dragging in the details. Sandra Bullock is also one of the producers, so the fact that the film doesn't make one lick of sense is hardly worth analyzing. She plays the author of violent, trashy adventure novels that appeal to giggling girls with IQs of less than 50. Mr. Tatum plays a boneheaded Muscles McGurk named Alan, the hunky model on all of her book jackets who actually thinks he's the heroic character she created in her schlocky novels called Dash. (For Dashiell Hammett, one erroneously presumes?) Daniel Radcliffe, the faded glory of his Harry Potter days a distant memory, plays a billionaire nutcase who kidnaps them on a book promotion tour, convinced that Loretta can lead his gang of murderous criminals to the ""well of endless tears,"" the location of buried treasure described in one of her novels. Brad Pitt plays Jack Trainer, an adventurer with Lady Gaga's hair who is recruited to rescue themnot on a white horse, but on a scooter with a broken muffler. They all end up on a volcanic island in the Atlantic (another joke that backfires) where Loretta thrashes her way through the brush in stiletto heels and a skin-tight purple sequin leotard, but hates getting wet (""I don't do water,"" she protests""my body becomes like an eighth grader's face,"" whatever that means.) Alas, she ends up in a river with Alan, who emerges covered with leeches in the film's funniest scene. Stripped naked, he bares his buttocks for her to ogle while she rips the leeches off his most intimate hot spots, saying ""It's like picking anchovies out of my favorite salad."" These are the jokes, and you don't know whether to laugh or continue the nap from which you've been rudely interrupted. ""All that time and money spent on a cheap metaphor,"" groans Daniel Radcliffe at the end of The Lost City. He must be describing the movie itself."

It's about capturing the sweet, wounded desperation of a man who's aware of the pressure on him to fulfil some kind of masculine ideal, but wouldn't even know where to start. The himbo, I'd argue, is an underrated feminist archetype, a positive image of masculinity that simultaneously critiques the kinds of wild expectations we place on men. It's all about subversion  that what he's ultimately valued for aren't the superficial markers of dominance or caveman brawn, but the pure goodness of his heart. Tatum has spent his entire career perfecting that kind of himbo, whether it be in the 21 Jump Street or Magic Mike films. And, finally, in The Lost City, he's been paired with his ideal opposite: Sandra Bullock, the actor you call to play very smart women who still can't seem to keep their lives together, who delivers in ways that are relatable as opposed to patronising. Though the film, directed by brothers Adam and Aaron Nee, presents itself as a 21st-century retread of Robert Zemeckis's adventure romcom Romancing the Stone, it's really the kind of project that's suctioned itself to its A-list leads like a barnacle on a ship. Bullock is the flinty but loveable Loretta Sage, an archaeologist who's become an emotional shut-in after her husband's untimely death. She's now slumming it  in her opinion  as the author of a series of steamy romance novels. Tatum is Alan Caprison, the cover model and now public face of Loretta's hunky creation, Dash McMahon. His dedication to the role mildly repulses her. At Loretta's latest book signing, he answers questions like he somehow had a hand in writing her work, before promptly ripping off his shirt. Alan, in a way, has become the physical manifestation of her own self-loathing. It doesn't help that her publicist, Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), insists that she turns up to the event in a sequinned jumpsuit so tight that it forces her to shuffle around like someone wrapped head-to-toe in medical bandages. It's not the ideal fit for what happens next. Loretta is kidnapped by the unloved son (a very game Daniel Radcliffe) of a media mogul, Abigail Fairfax, who's convinced the tidbits of historical knowledge littered throughout her books make her the key to finding the lost Crown of Fire. The treasure is said to be buried deep beneath a volcanic island out in the Atlantic, somewhere in the ruins of The Lost City of D, which has recently exposed itself to the elements. Well, technically, as Abigail points out, it's exposed ""just the tip"". Expect much more innuendo where that came from."

In any case, the cycle continues with Adam and Aaron Nee's The Lost City, basically an off-brand reboot of Romancing the Stone. Sandra Bullock is romantic adventure novelist Loretta Sage, a shut-in who has lost her mojo after the death of her archaeologist husband. Even her fans are less interested in her latest book than in seeing her hunky cover model Alan (Channing Tatum) rip his shirt off. In the meantime, however, the book is drawing attention in other quarters, since it may contain clues to the whereabouts of a fabled treasure on a remote island off the coast of Latin America. (Also on this island is the Lost City of the title, which proves somewhat more peripheral than you'd expect.) A few hours into an already disastrous book tour, Loretta is kidnapped and transported to the island, still wearing the sequinned pink jumpsuit insisted on by her publicist (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). Alan leaps at the chance to be a hero for real, and soon they're racing for their lives through the jungle, though not at a pace that prevents them from gradually getting to know each other on a more than professional basis. It's all quite sweet, in its cartoonish way. Unlike Loretta, Bullock shows no sign of leaving her comfort zone, nor is she close to matching Kathleen Turner's inventive Romancing the Stone performance. But as an old hand at the romance game in her own right, she capably balances sharpness, warmth and melancholy. The real drawcard is Tatum, paradoxically showing his confidence in his masculinity though his willingness to embrace the traditionally feminine ""bimbo"" role. In this sense the whole film works on two levels: the outward emphasis on Alan's harmlessness suggests it could be made for mothers to watch with their 12-year-old daughters, despite a handful of risque lines. Similarly tween-friendly is Daniel Radcliffe's comic turn as the pipsqueak villain, driven by fury at having been passed over as heir to his father's media empire (if there's a specific real-life model, I didn't work it out). Brad Pitt presumably picked up an easy couple of million for his peripheral role as a hard-boiled adventurer who speaks in amusing non sequiturs. The jokes in general are hit-and-miss, but more work has been put into them than into the action sequences, which are infrequent and indifferently staged. Cinematographer Jonathan Sela, who shot the first John Wick, hasn't been allowed to bring much to the party: the look is flat and overlit, with obvious shifts between studio sets and the Dominican Republic locations. Ultimately there is not much to recommend The Lost City beyond a degree of unpretentious good nature, plus the appeal of its stars.

My excitement to watch this film knew no bounds, especially given the star-studded cast it boasted. It rekindled my childhood enthusiasm for adventurous treasure hunts on hidden islands, deciphering cryptic hieroglyphics, and embarking on thrilling escapades. At the heart of the movie are two protagonists: Loretta Sage (played by Sandra Bullock), a romance novelist, and Alan/Dash (portrayed by Channing Tatum), her renowned cover model. Loretta's novel, ""The Lost City of D,"" tantalizes readers with its enigmatic title, sparking wild speculations. But it's not what you might assume. Their journey unfolds on a perilous expedition to an uncharted paradise island, albeit not of their own volition. Loretta is kidnapped by a delusional, bittersweet billionaire, a media mogul who believes she holds the key to discovering treasure in a lost city on that very island, mirroring the plot of her own book. My initial expectation, fueled by uproarious laughter induced by the trailer, was that this movie would captivate me from start to finish. Regrettably, that wasn't the case. It turned out to be somewhat lackluster, with moments of disappointment and monotony. Nevertheless, the same scenes that had amused me in the trailer still had me in stitches, along with some previously unseen gems. These redeeming moments make me inclined to recommend the film to others. I would, however, temper my recommendation by acknowledging that it may not live up to the hype but is still suitable for a laid-back day of viewing. Given the track record of Brad Pitt, Channing Tatum, and Sandra Bullock, I can't recall a single instance where their performances have fallen flat. Consequently, I attribute any shortcomings solely to the production team. The plot was passable, while the storyline struck me as a bit wishy-washy. Certain segments left me pondering, ""Why was that even included?"" Additionally, I have reservations about the casting choices. Sandra and Channing certainly embodied their roles, and Brad Pitt, while fitting his character, seemed an unconventional choice for this particular storyline or genre. Frankly, I don't envision him as a comedic actor. I regret to say that Daniel Radcliffe felt out of place in this ensemble. He was an exceptional child actor in the Harry Potter series, but this role didn't suit him. I found myself wincing, thinking, ""No, perhaps it's time to step away from acting."" The remaining cast members appeared disengaged and seemed to be present merely to fulfill their roles in making a movie, resulting in characters that felt lackluster. Maybe I should consider watching a 'behind the scenes' episode to uncover the rationale behind that rather questionable outfit (the onesie) they dressed Loretta in. I must admit, I found it quite dreadful. Sandra Bullock possesses an enviable physique, especially for her age, but that suit felt entirely out of place, even for a book interview.

She's the flame and we're the moths, entranced by her power to charm and entertain. As much as Bullock impresses in serious dramatic roles, such as she did in Gravity, it's in comedy where she unleashes her true dominance. The Lost City is exactly the kind of throwback rom-com adventure that is elevated from fine to riotous thanks to the presence of Bullock. It's the kind of role that allows her to showcase her impeccable timing, physical comedy prowess and some dramatic chops. Not to mention her sizzling chemistry with Channing Tatum. Everyone is having a grand old time, from a wild Brad Pitt cameo to an unhinged Daniel Radcliffe  an unhinged Daniel Radcliffe is the best Daniel Radcliffe and he's leaving nothing on the table in The Lost City. Bullock plays Loretta Sage, a romance novelist who has become a recluse after the death of her husband, unable to face the world outside her home. When she's forced to promote her latest book on tour, she's once again in the presence of Alan (Tatum), the model who poses as the literary hero Dash on her book covers. Other than a propensity for channelling Gob Bluth's choreography to ""Final Countdown"", Alan has something of a crush on Loretta even though she doesn't take him seriously. During a promotional stop, Loretta is bundled into a car by two goons working for high-strung billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Radcliffe), who believes Loretta is the key to unlocking the whereabouts of lost treasure ""Crown of Fire"". The well-meaning but clueless Alan leaps to the rescue as he and Loretta try to outrun and outsmart Fairfax and his crew on an island with an active volcano. It's not just the gun-toting mercenaries they need to survive, it's also the many, many threats lurking in the jungle. You don't have to be a cinephile to know exactly where The Lost City is going, especially if you've seen Romancing the Stone  its predictability is an assurance of its genre and it checks all the tropes. But it doesn't even matter because they're exactly the story beats you want in a movie like this  the destination isn't the point, it's the journey. And The Lost City, directed by Adam and Aaron Nee, is a joyous journey that's engrossing, funny and thoroughly entertaining. The jokes are sharp, tailored to its perfectly cast ensemble  if anything, there could be more of them. The scenarios are, of course, outlandish and defy logic, and there's more than a few scenes that were clearly shot in front of a green screen while the pacing starts to falter in the final stretch. But it's easy to set aside those quibbles when the alchemical mix of Bullock and Tatum's performances is more than enough to carry audiences along on a merry, effortless escapade."

I remember a time when there was possibly a big comedy coming out every one or two months, with at least half of them being good, but in today's climate, humour is just tough to get right. I was very happy to see that Paramount would be taking a chance and releasing a big comedy in The Lost City this year, but I truly didn't know to what to expect from it. After seeing it in theatres, I'm happy to say that I had a good time with it. It's not great, but it felt like a throwback comedy, just with a modern twist. To put it simply, The Lost City follows Loretta (Sandra Bullock) as she's on a book tour with her cover model Alan (Channing Tatum) to promote the release of ""The Lost City of D,"" but they are swept up in a kidnapping and find themselves on a real adventure in the jungle. Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) is the reason Loretta was kidnapped in the first place, as he sees many similarities in her book to that of a real lost city. Being the privileged twerp that he is makes for a fun villainous storyline, even if it's pretty lame at times. Radcliffe aside (whom I still enjoyed), this film puts all of its weight on Tatum and Bullock to deliver the goods. This premise is clever enough to work as a film, but it all comes down to who you cast and if they can make the material work. I never thought I needed to see this duo together, but I'm very happy they worked so well. On top of that, I have to admit that the best moments in the film feature Brad Pitt's character Jack Trainer. He isn't in the film much, but every second he was on screen had me laughing. Where I found the film to be slightly uneven though, was in the fact that I wasn't sure if it wanted to be funny or dramatic at times. I'm all for heartfelt storylines as well as comedy, but I would argue that the majority of the humour is in the first half, while the second half gets a little more sentimental. These both worked in the movie, but the way the film begins gives absolutely no foreshadowing as to what the film will become by the end. I found that odd, but again, the cast sold all of the dialogue for me. From a few hilarious moments to some fun adventure/action throughout, as I said, I had a good time with this one. In the end, The Lost City is exactly what I think moviegoers need right now. Nothing too serious or weighed down by heavy drama. This is a good old-fashioned, silly comedy/romance that I feel works for what it is. It's not going to be the type of comedy that a lot of people are going"
137,DIR_Doc7_Lost_City,DIR_Doc7_Lost_City,DIR,Comedy,Positive,Lost_City,"The Pace Is Good: Say what you want about the film, but I can't lie that the pace is much better than I anticipated this movie having. The Lost City has a lot of elements combined, but somehow balances a lot of the perspectives into a decently timed film that does not break the bank. A slower opening is curtailed by short time spending in it, but yet not enough to offset the important character building they are working on obtaining. It's quite a delight to be honest, and keeping that pace going works to keep some of the staler comedy tactics from being too hard to follow. The Character Involvement: A movie loaded with casts like this are certainly something that gives me chills, primarily in how many times their characters are wasted in this movie. However, the movie surprises me again in how well it keeps using the characters that they introduce. While Tatum and Bullock do indeed have most of the screen time, Brad Pitt, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and Oscar Nunez do get their fair share of inclusion in this movie to stay relevant to the plot and relationships of the character. Juggling all these characters without intruding too much is not an easy challenge, yet the comedy does well to really keep these pieces progressing down the same path. The Acting: Surprisingly better than I anticipated, the movie brought out A game in comedy acting for much of the film despite the direction the film took. Radcliffe sort of reprises his role of the bratty villain again (see Now You See Me 2) , and he seems to be having fun with the role that he is trying to make come alive. He succeeds on many levels, and his level of hyperbolic comedy fits well into the movie's tone that fans will really enjoy the laughable character before them. Tatum is well Tatum on many levels of the movie, bringing that airheaded, naive and street boy like demeanor that you either love or hate. His banter comedy and one-line delivery are on point in this film, and if you like the irony of a physically fit guy being very idiotic and incompetent on levels, then you are right at home in this film. To be fair though, he does also bring the vulnerable side out very well, and I give him props for finally bringing a more realistic and relatable character than what I have gotten from most of his other films. As for Bullock, the woman is on fire as she often is for me in her films. Combining the sarcasm of Miss Congeniality, the searching for life's moments from the Blind Side, and the attitude from Speed is how I can describe her character. Bullock manages to bring these sides together into a very good character, that helps convey the message of the movie, but never sacrifice the other elements that the film is attempting to achieve. A fantastic centerpiece to the character web,"
138,DIR_Doc8_Lost_City,DIR_Doc8_Lost_City,DIR,Comedy,Negative,Lost_City,"The Plot's Lack Of Adventure: I can take off points for the high-level of predictability that is loaded into this movie, but what I think if fairer is that the adventure element is surprisingly limited to mostly what you see in the trailers. The Lost City's battling of dangerous criminals and the threats of the jungle has been laid out for you in those trailers, and while enjoyable there was so much more that could have been done. More animals they had to outwit, or more environmental hazards to use against the pursuing threats could have further amped up this movie's wow factor for me than what they did. This would be especially true in trying to solve the puzzle that got them into this mess, and finding more clues in the world to help beef up the mystery element. Radcliffe's Character: While the former Harry Potter legend does the role well, it does not mean I enjoyed the villain any better. Fairfax is lame, a villain that is just a less polished version of the brat from Now You See Me 2, and I would have liked again either better comedy with him, or some element that made him a bigger threat than what we got. I get the point of the comedy is to integrate them into the mix, I really do, but the fact we could not integrate a better character into the mix that did not have to be an incompetent boob would have helped the adventure element of this plot they were striving to reach. Cheesy In Your Face Moments: It's hard to avoid these moments in the style this comedy is presented in, but there are times where the cheese factor can be a little bit too much for a viewer like me. After seeing a few moments that feel raw, emotionally gut punching, and relatable to the point it hurts, to see the Hollywood rub it in your face moments are a little meh in my taste. Sure, they do bring the romantic comedy vibe with them, but they could have done a little better with that mess if they timed it better, or used it in a comedic moment rather. It's by far from the worst gospel moments I've seen, but it does still exist at times. The Random Interruption of Pace: The movie does well keeping that fun and fast pace moment to really keep us moving towards the goal of survival, but then hits this random moment that sort of trips the entire element. About three-quarters through the movie, we randomly drop into this one moment that completely drops the mood into an off-kilter moment belonging in a Sparks' novel movie, that while heartwarming and emotional, feels out of place amidst the rest of the movie. It's not that there were not enjoyable moments to it, but it's the scene that feels shoved in the most compared to the other elements I saw earlier in the film. Needed More Time:"
139,DIR_Doc9_Lost_City,DIR_Doc9_Lost_City,DIR,Comedy,Positive,Lost_City,"Here's a comedy with the closest thing to an ""all-star cast"" we've seen in quite a while -- Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum, Daniel Radcliffe and Brad Pitt all in one movie. It's silly, but a lot of fun. Sandra Bullock plays a romance-novel writer who is burned out with her work, but still revered by her fans. Channing Tatum is the doofus but well-meaning ""cover model"" for all of her books. Daniel Radcliffe is a rich super-fan who is convinced the story in her latest novel is true, and kidnaps her to help him track down something called the ""gold crown,' which is similar to the Tesseract from the Marvel movies, I guess. Of course, the cover model gets swept along on the adventure and you can probably guess the rest. Channing Tatum has most of the best lines in the show. It's a role that seems like it may have been written for Chris Pratt, but Tatum still does a good job with it. He's got great comic timing. The chemistry between him and Sandra Bullock is ... well, a little awkward at first, but hey, if Tom Cruise can always get the young great-looking love interest, why can't Sandra Bullock? I mean, fair is fair. In the scene that draws the most laughs, you get to see Channing's naked torso and butt for what seems like 9 or 10 minutes, so that's a plus for people who like the ""beefcake."" This scene goes on for a good minute after everybody in the audience has stopped laughing -- a little judicious editing would have been good. Unfortunately Sandra's rear end stays covered up throughout the movie, although she does exhibit the standard female-action-movie-star cliches of being in high heels, and having a costume that gets skimpier and skimpier as the movie goes on. Daniel Radcliffe, as possibly the wimpiest ""bad guy"" the screen has ever seen since Dr. Evil in the ""Austin Powers"" movies, seems kind of wasted in his role. Maybe they should have given THAT part to Chris Pratt. But it's kind of cool to see Daniel having some fun with a role that isn't Harry Potter. Brad Pitt steals the show in a short cameo and a mid-credits scene. Another good casting addition was Oscar Nunez, who played ""Oscar"" on the TV show ""The Office,"" as the smart-alecky owner of a boat that takes our heroes to and from their great adventure. In this movie his character is also named Oscar. Maybe that's in his contract, he must always play guys named Oscar. Anyway, he's pretty funny in his couple of scenes, and he also gets one of the best lines in the movie as Daniel Radcliffe is trying to escape: ""Why would you run? It's a BOAT."" The locations are top-notch (it was filmed in the Dominican Republic) and the story, while kind of improbable, doesn't require too much thought to ride along with. For good mindless fun movie entertainment, which we could really use"
140,DIR_Doc10_Lost_City,DIR_Doc10_Lost_City,DIR,Comedy,Negative,Lost_City,"""The Lost City"" is a big mess  a big enough mess that it doesn't even get credit for knowing it's a mess  but it stars Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, so that helps. It doesn't make it worth seeing, but it keeps the experience outside the realm of pain. Yet in one way the casting actually hurts: When actors who are really, really good at comedy apply themselves to dialogue that is really, really weak, you feel the strain. You feel the outline of the joke that wasn't there  and the vicarious embarrassment of a failed acrobatic turn that goes splat. String enough splat moments together, and you have a movie that could have been good, but isn't. The setup is fine. Bullock is Loretta, a romance novelist who has become reclusive since her husband's death. On a tour for her latest book, one she doesn't even like, she is paired with Alan (Tatum), a model who has appeared on the cover of all the books in her celebrated series. At this point, the Fabio-like model has more fans than Loretta, and Tatum is funny, tossing his (wigged) long blond hair and preening for his fans. One gets the sense that if the story just found a way to stay there, on that tour, the movie would have found its way to something enjoyable. But then the plot kicks in. A spoiled and somewhat demented young scion of the Fairfax media empire (Daniel Radcliffe)  these days, every evil character is a fictional rendition of someone from the Murdoch family  approaches Loretta with a proposition. Because of her knowledge of ancient languages, he wants her help finding the buried treasure of some lost civilization. That's a reasonable offer. He needs help translating clues to the treasure, and he's willing to pay her anything she asks. But she says no, so he kidnaps her and brings her to the island anyway. It would be missing the point of a movie like this to quibble too much about illogical turns of plot. But even in a goofy confection like ""The Lost City,"" it's hard not to notice when characters consistently behave against their own best interests, seemingly to help the screenwriters perpetuate the story. Over and over  I'd describe this in detail, but it wouldn't be worth reading  the characters are shoehorned into actions that don't make sense and that undercut both the story and the comedy. The movie has two bright spots. Brad Pitt makes a brief appearance as the man who can get them off the island. Bullock asks him how he happened to become so handsome and he answers, ""My father was a weatherman."" Bullock and Tatum also have a funny moment, right after they accidentally force two bad guys on motorcycles to go off a cliff. In what plays like an ad lib, the two start finishing each other's sentences, talking guiltily about how they didn't really mean for that to happen."
141,GYX_Doc1_Hereditary,GYX_Doc1_Hereditary,GYX,Horror,Positive,Hereditary,"Creepy beyond belief, ""Hereditary"" is one of those movies you shouldn't describe in detail, because if you do, it will not only ruin surprises but make the listener wonder if you saw the film or dreamed it. The movie sustains a throb of dread throughout its first 90 minutes, and its final 30 are off-the-rails in the best way. Writer/director Ari Aster structures the tale so that it's hard to be sure if the uncanny events you're seeing are real or figments of the imaginations of the Graham family, a clan cursed both by Biblical bad luck and a genetic disposition towards various types of mental illness. Toni Collette stars as Annie Graham, an artist and mother who's coping with the death of her mother while trying to finish an exhibition of dioramas that appear to depict her own family's life and Annie's internal state. Alex Wolff is Annie's oldest child, Peter, a sad-eyed pothead drifting through life. Milly Shapiro plays Charlie, Peter's younger sister, a disturbed 13-year-old with the dead stare of a statue. Gabriel Byrne plays Annie's stoic, kindhearted husband Steve, who just wants the family to be happy and struggles to make peace. All are reeling from the death of the family matriarch, who we learn was anything but cuddly. The family is uncomfortable with frank displays of emotion, and with anything that might reveal their interiors to one another. Annie tells her husband that she's going off to the movies when she's really attending a grief management circle that meets in a church basement. Peter anesthetizes himself with marijuana. Charlie draws obsessively in a small notebook, and ... Well, maybe I shouldn't tell you about the things I was just about to tell you about. Maybe it's better if you just experience the story on your own. The deeper that ""Hereditary"" pulled me in, the more grateful I was that I didn't know much about it before setting foot in the theaterincluding what relationship, if any, the plot has to the movie's one word title. Film literate in the extreme, ""Hereditary"" seems inspired by a wide array of classic sources both inside and outside of the horror genre. ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" loom large, as do Asian horror touchstones like ""The Grudge"" and ""The Eye."" But the film owes just as much to the intense family psychodramas of Mike Leigh and John Cassavetes, which place strong-willed but deeply damaged people in close proximity and look on as they suffer barely-concealed torment from sitting on their rage, then finally lash out in displays of emotional violence that are as intense, in their own way, as the bloodletting and surrealism. Unspeakable things happen to the family throughout. Every time they experience new trauma, it cracks their controlling facades a bit more, exposes emotional fissures in the family as a whole, and makes you wonder if perhaps the social institutions surrounding us and the intricate practices of language, science, and literature"
142,GYX_Doc2_Hereditary,GYX_Doc2_Hereditary,GYX,Horror,Positive,Hereditary,"There's little that scares humans more than knowing we lack control of our lives, except possibly, the inability to protect one's children. Hereditary is a double shot of both. It's an uneasy and visually well-crafted horror exploring our parental fears. It's also a film that, surprise, surprise, has split opinions among audiences and critics. My review will be divided into two sections: the first will be a general overview of my thoughts, while the second will discuss the film's ending and its rejection of the female form. Heredity opens with Annie, a mother of two, presiding over the funeral of her secretive mother. Annie's family isn't a picture-perfect suburban landscape. Her son is a common teenager, a little weird and loves to get high. Her daughter (Charlie) is an outcast, making dolls out of junk and dead animals. Charlie often believes that her grandmother wanted her to be a boy. There's plenty of rejection of the female form in Hereditary, as women are either helpless, deviant, or ""crazy,"" but rarely suitable. I'll talk more about that a tad bit later. As with A Quiet Place, sometimes sound-queues can be just as terrifying as any jump scare (having a seen/unseen effect). And like most great horror films, the fear of sound taps into our instincts. Your ancestors in their caves, who feared the sound of a broken twig during the night, and you who hate the creak of your floor, are one and the same. Here, the reoccurring sound of ""cluck"" inhabits that fear. I guarantee you that if Hereditary takes off, that sound made by Charlie will be a pop-culture force. Also, Toni Collette is unforgettable in the role of Annie. Her shrieks, those piercing shrieks, are indelible manifestations of a parents' inability to protect their children. It's stunning how Collette is able to transition from the initial bitterness toward her now deceased and past estranged mother to a wild exploration of grief and fear. And while I do think a bid for an Academy Award nomination will be difficult for Collette (if such things really matter), it doesn't disrupt that if you're not a fan of Hereditary, you will be of her as she holds this narratively uneven film together. In fact, up-and-down, Hereditary features strong-performance-after-strong-performance. From Milly Shapiro as Charlie, to Alex Wolff as Peter, to Gabriel Byrne as Steve, all are an intricate mix of loneliness, guilt, and calm. Also, Ann Dowd as Joan never ceases to amaze me. Dowd has found her niche as the slightly or greatly unhinged grandmotherly figure, whether that's here, in The Handmaid's Tale, or in A Kid Like Jake. These components are knitted together by director Ari Aster. Aster, with his first feature film, is also masterful at seizing upon the landscape spatiality of the screen. His use of long pans is not only representative of the miniatures made by Annie (miniatures that are solely stylistic without any intrinsic value to the story), but also religious medieval tapestry. Both the landscape"
143,GYX_Doc3_Hereditary,GYX_Doc3_Hereditary,GYX,Horror,Positive,Hereditary,"Hereditary builds scares like a Conjuring-grade funhouse movie, tightening moments until a jump scarethat single moment of spiking, adrenaline-squirting frightwould almost be relief. But then something different happens. Instead of looking for you to yelp, Hereditary stabs a disturbing emotion into your gut. More than being scary (though it is scary), Hereditary is upsetting. Rather than creeping dread (though there is creeping dread), Hereditary feels like an endless drawing out of that queasy, shocking, falling dream sensation, as the ground beneath the Graham family, and the viewer, crumbles. We are introduced to the Grahams in an obituary, announcing the death of family matriarch Ellen in the antiseptic language unique to the form, which both reveals a family's structure and obscures how those components interact, live and feel. We learn, for example, that Ellen's son, brother to Annie (Toni Collette), preceded her in death, gesturing toward tragedy but failing to illuminate it. It's only later, as Annie breaks down in front of a grief support group, that this single line in an obituary inflates into the dreadful shape of familial mental illness, self-destruction and suicide. That the horrific deaths of her brother and father work simultaneously as a gut-wrenching reality and supernatural foreshadowing is just one way Hereditary layers human and horror dramas atop each other to jaw-clenching effect. Annie is an artist who builds tiny dioramas, mostly of domestic scenes, though shocking events soon find their way into her art. If interactions with her son devolve into icy silence and screaming fights, Annie can always enshrine a terrible family moment in the perfect stillness of her work. Her children, Charlie (Milly Shapiro) and Peter (Alex Wolff), are familiar varieties of troubled. Charlie is too shy and a little morbid, creating disjointed figures out of dead animal parts and household itemstwisted versions of her mother's artistic work, the daughter an exaggerated recursion of the parent. Peter is a pothead and your typical teenage misanthrope. And while Charlie's unnerving stare and habitual mouth *click* definitely put her on the creepy kid spectrum, the Hereditary family is, at least at first, relatable in its dysfunction, with only Annie's sleepwalking (which occasionally enacts her suppressed regrets at having children) and the specter of Ellen indicating problems more dangerous than those typical of millions of households. Shortly after Ellen's funeral, her grave is desecrated. And while it's little more than a narrative aside, bundled away by the family's taciturn and conflict-smoothing father, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), it's also our first indication that something much more than family drama and unhatched mental illness is at play. When Annie bumps into a woman who offers to put her in touch with the deadan offer extended with the same neighborly hominess as a plate of browniestheir problems escalate from merely tragic into occult realms of terror, where familial peccadilloes become fuel for inhuman powers. Annie occult experiments quickly get out of hand. It's easiest to describe Hereditary as a dark family drama turned deadlysomething like Stoker, or The Squid"
144,GYX_Doc4_Hereditary,GYX_Doc4_Hereditary,GYX,Horror,Positive,Hereditary,"Minutes after its midnight premiere at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, Ari Aster's ""Hereditary"" was drawing comparisons to previous Sundance horror hits like ""The Babadook"" and ""It Follows."" Now, Sundance regulars are often correctly skeptical of how those willing to stay up till 2AM for a horror movie respondit's often a bit, shall we say, genre-biasedbut this is a case in which the film completely lives up to the hype. ""Hereditary"" is a deeply unsettling film, the kind of horror movie that pulls from relatable human emotions like grief and resentment to ultimately become an absolute nightmare. The ""Babadook"" and ""It Comes at Night"" comparisons will undeniably be made, but Aster is actually recalling the more European styles of Roman Polanski and Dario Argento, men unafraid to work in more symbolic, nightmarish registers than what audiences expect from a traditional horror movie and willing to really go there. In fact, the ways in which Aster defies traditional expectations is likely to make this a very divisive flick when it's released by A24 later this year, although these conversation-starters are typically the movies that last the test of time. At least the nightmares it produces will. The always-great Toni Collette does possibly the best work of her career as Annie Graham, an artist (she designs miniature models that often replicate her own home life, which is clearly a reference to a filmmaker producing a film that he's admitted comes from his own personal life) and mother of two. Annie is married to Steve (a grounded Gabriel Byrne) and is raising teenagers Peter (Alex Wolff) and Charlie (Milly Shapiro). As the film opens, Annie is dealing with the loss of her mother, from whom she was relatively estranged. The tumult of emotions that come from losing a loved one that you didn't particularly like is incredibly well-captured by Collette. She's not as sad as she ""should be,"" but there's still something unsettled in the air around the Graham family. And it's not only because she may have seen the ghost of her mother in the corner of her studio. ""Hereditary"" is a film that's best gone into ice cold, so I'll be incredibly vague from here. Suffice to say, something horrible happens to the Graham familyand I mean so horrible you may need to pause the film and decide if you can continue when you watch this from home (and I wouldn't blame you if you can't). You should persevere. Not only is it an incredibly daring turn for the film to take but it really serves as the hill from which the rest of this rollercoaster of a movie builds up speed. Like a great thrill ride, what's most remarkable about Aster's confident direction is how deftly he paces his film. It's not a film built on jump scares or action sequencesit is a metronomic series of hills and valleys, always propelling viewers forward, strapped to their seats in fear. Horror filmmakers have often used tragedy to open the door to"
145,GYX_Doc5_Hereditary,GYX_Doc5_Hereditary,GYX,Horror,Positive,Hereditary,"""Hereditary"" is one of those rare and treasured horror films that does not rely on ""Gotcha!"" music stings, or rhythmic knocks on the door in the dead of night, or the cat jumping into frame during a tense moment. The shock moments here (including one that might send one or two viewers running for the exit) are truly stunning, and grotesque, and bizarre  and they will stay with you long after you've gone home for the night. For much of the first hour, writer-director Ari Aster uses a slow build to craft this sinister story, effectively building the foundation for the madhouse we'll eventually occupy. Annie is a renowned artist who specializes in meticulously crafted miniature tableaus  wondrous and sometimes disturbing doll houses, if you will  based on the people and the rooms and the events in her own life. (Hmmm, could this be a metaphor for Annie's desire to control everything around her and perhaps to even play an omniscient role? Hmmmmmm.) ""Hereditary"" begins with a funeral, the memorial service for Annie's mother, a cold and distant and strange woman who never bonded with Annie but had a special connection with Annie's daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro doing staggeringly fine work). Charlie is a strange child. Very strange. She is constantly scribbling dark sketches in her notebook, she's unable to connect with others on even a basic social level, and she has morbid interests that extend to carrying around the head of a recently deceased bird. She even prefers to sleep in the family treehouse, as if she's a figurine in one of her mother's miniaturist creations. After a second death impacts the Graham family, Annie bonds with Joan (the amazing Ann Dowd), a warm and sympathetic mother figure she had met at a grief counseling session. Joan (in deep mourning of her own for a son and grandson killed in an accident) introduces Annie to a portal to the next world, a way for Annie to perhaps connect with the deceased. Soon, Annie is a believer, much to the consternation of her grounded, passive husband and much to the horror of their teenage son Peter (Alex Wolff), who is dealing with all sorts of freaky baggage on his own. (Let's just say Peter's worst nightmares are almost certainly way more disturbing than your worst nightmares.). The cinematography by Pawel Pogorzelski is a beautifully frightening blend of the realistic (most of the scenes that take place outside of the home) and the surreal (just about everything that occurs within the confines of the Graham home.) The sets are exquisite, somehow giving off a creepy vibe even when it seems as if we're just looking at furniture and light fixtures and a dining room table. (Something about this house just doesn't feel right.) Even though Annie's mother is almost never seen onscreen, she is a constant presence in the film. Annie is nearly obsessed with establishing she's nothing like her mother  even as she confesses certain actions"
146,GYX_Doc6_Hereditary,GYX_Doc6_Hereditary,GYX,Horror,Negative,Hereditary,"Breathless comparisons to The Exorcist, The Shining and Psycho do this fitfully frightening yet ultimately frustrating chiller few favours. Talented writer-director Ari Aster's flawed feature debut has more in common with such recently challenging titles as The Witch or It Comes at Night (both also distributed in the US by indie-kings A24), although this tale of a cursed family possesses neither the sustained bone-chilling intensity of the former nor the sociopolitical dread of the latter. Veering erratically between promising setups and disappointing payoffs, it shifts from something reminiscent of the scary satire of Ira Levin toward the altogether dopier domain of Dennis Wheatley. Ironically, it's the very things that Hereditary gets just right that make its clunkier missteps seem so wrong. We start in fine form, with an Ordinary People-style opening that seems to ask: ""What's wrong with this picture?"" Following the death of her mother, Ellen, a secretive woman with ""private rituals, private friends"", artist Annie (Toni Collette) feels her world falling apart. Unable to mourn (""Should I be sadder?"") and prone to sleepwalking, she pours her troubles into her work, building small-world miniatures that resemble doll's houses designed by Diane Arbus. It's into one of these models that cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski's camera creeps in the opening sequence, segueing seamlessly into the internecine action, suggesting that everything we see is happening in a weirdly artificial world, constructed by Annie's inherited anxieties. That sense of unease grows as Annie's family scuttle around the shadows of their haunted home. Her disconnected daughter, Charlie (arresting Broadway star Milly Shapiro), cries out for her grandma, and makes strange clucking sounds while fashioning morbid totems. Husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), has the air of a condemned man as he fields calls from the cemetery about Ellen's last resting place. As for teenage son, Peter (Alex Wolff), he just wants to get stoned with his buddies, clearly unable to deal with the unspoken secrets lurking in his family's past (""Nobody admits anything they've done!""). And then something happens that turns grief into traumatised terror, reopening old wounds and inviting in new horrors. To reveal specifics would risk spoiling one of the most genuinely alarming sequences I've seen in recent years  a breathtaking jolt that made me gasp and recoil, intensified by the protracted shell-shocked silence that follows. It's a bravura cinematic coup, setting the scene for a spine-tingling meditation on grief and guilt, our senses sharpened by the promise of further scares. Those familiar with Aster's short films The Strange Thing About the Johnsons and Munchausen will be primed for a poisonous dissection of twisted family rituals. Elsewhere, a 90-degree camera-tilt mirrors a memorable moment from Babak Anvari's Under the Shadow, an astute point of reference from another tale of a besieged mother. All the more disappointing, then, that what follows gradually downshifts into generic cliche, abandoning well-mapped psychogeography for psychokinetic silliness and superfluous plot exposition.

147,GYX_Doc7_Hereditary,GYX_Doc7_Hereditary,GYX,Horror,Negative,Hereditary,"There's no denying the frequent blunt-force effectiveness of writer-director Ari Aster's smugly agitating feature debut, Hereditary, which begins with a showoffy shot that slowly rotates around the studio of professional diorama artist Annie Graham (Toni Collette). The camera eventually pushes into one of Annie's models, which imperceptibly becomes a life-size bedroom inhabited by her husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), and their pothead son, Peter (Alex Wolff). This isn't the last time spaces, and the spaces within them, will be utilized in unnerving, disorienting fashion. (Note, for instance, the many establishing shots of the Grahams' isolated woodland home that alternate between real-world and miniature exteriors.) Yet the overall effect is gloomy and humorless, as if Aster is doing a stone-faced gloss on the Wes Anderson-parodying SNL skit ""The Midnight Coterie of Sinister Intruders."" Aster is clearly out to mirror his protagonist's volatile headspace with such disruptive visuals. Annie is reeling from the death of her mother, whom she never much liked but who still had ahint, hintbewitching effect on the family. It's been barely a week since the woman's burial and everyone is still on edge. Annie throws herself into prep for a gallery show and reluctantly attends a grief support group to blow off steam. Steve gets a call from the cemetery where Annie's mom is interred and hides some upsetting news from his wife: that the woman's grave has been desecrated. And Peter acts the rebelliously dazed and confused adolescent, though there's something amiss in his glazed expression, as if dope isn't the only demon on his shoulder. It certainly would be easiest to blame a Satanic influence for the fateful night when Annie forces Peter to take his sickly, mentally challenged younger sister, Charlie (Milly Shapiro)whose habit of clucking her tongue occasions a few memorable jump scaresto a high school party. Charlie has an allergic reaction after eating a piece of cake with nuts in it. Spaced-out Peter rushes her to his car, hightailing it for a hospital. And then something gruesome occurs that pushes an already troubled brood into a deranged red zone. This section of Hereditary impressively puts any supernatural sturm und drang on the back burner and unflinchingly charts the fraying family bonds. There are a few snake-tongued confrontations between Annie and Peter that are particularly bracing as long-held resentments come to the fore, such as Annie's revulsion at ever having children in the first place. Collette's jittery performance is on the fine line between ridiculous and sublime, and she's best suited to these scenes in which the horrors her character faces are of the shadowy variety, the paranormal occurrences seeming to spring from a psychologically tangible and turbulent place. Is Annie actually seeing her dead mother in a dark corner of the room, for example, or is it a mere manifestation of her fractured subconscious? It's best left imprecise. Once it becomes apparent that the Graham family truly is a target of otherworldly malevolence, however, the film loses its menacing power and becomes a monotonous"

Hereditary, the long, pretentious occult thriller that follows, boasts the four-word label in film-festival jargon that often reliably guarantee a torturous disaster: ""Big Hit at Sundance!"" As alleged horror films go, this one is about as scary as the Bowery Boys in Spooks Run Wild. One week after Mom is buried, Annie finds a secret journal she left behind about spiritualism. Her grave is desecrated, so we know she's coming back. Then the kids go weird. After cutting off the head of a dead bird, socially inept 13-year-old daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro) is forced to tag along with her stoned, pot-smoking older brother Peter (Alex Wolff) to a party where she swallows something lethal and on the way home he severs her own head in a fatal car accident. The already loopy Annie goes totally schizophrenic. Oh, yes. Since you asked, there is a husband-father figure in Steve, but all he does is mope around passively, looking catatonic. Through a member of her grief-counseling group who contacted her dead grandson with the help of a medium, Annie conducts her own seance and conjures up Charlie from beyond the grave. Things pick up mildly when gossamer spirits float through the house and Grandma's headless body is found in the attic. Peter goes berserk and bashes his head against his desk in school. Annie tries to destroy Charlie's drawing book but her arm catches on fire. Lit only by candles, the freaky house turns into a cross between The Witch and Poltergeist, minus the thrills or imagination of either. Begged by the distributor not to reveal the banal surprises that await you, I will only say that Utah plays the door to Hell and Toni Collette has never appeared more deranged and out of control. First-time director Ari Aster leads her through the gates of insanity and beyond, without a single hair-raising moment. As the incidents in the Graham household intensify, the results grow tragic, but clocking in at more than two hours, Hereditary loses so much momentum that it can't tell the difference between tragedy and tedium. It contains so few ""gotcha"" moments that box-office doom seems inescapable (I saw it in a multiplex on a Saturday night with fewer than 20 people in the audience) and there is not even a mandatory throat-tightening payoff. It ends with Judy Collins singing Joni Mitchell's ballad ""Both Sides Now"", which makes even less sense than the movie itself. These days actors not only appear in bad movies, they are forced to produce their own flops themselves. Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne co-executive produced Hereditary. They deserve what they get, in spades."

If you haven't seen a lot, most of it will shock the ever-loving bejesus out of you. If you have seen quite a few, you might get a kick out of counting all the bits that you've seen in other films from the genre. Or, if you're a big horror movie fan, you might be confounded or even angry at those derivative bits being tossed in, along with one too many other ideas that end up seriously marring the last act. The film falls just short of greatness due to its wildly overplayed finale. The shame of it is that ""Hereditary"" is quite terrific before it unravels. Assuredly written and directed by Ari Aster, the film is filled with dread rather than a high body count. The film's production values are exemplary, particularly the deliberate camera work and subtle sound design. And it contains an intensely committed and affecting performance by lead Toni Collette, not to mention able support by her fellow cast members Gabriel Byrne, Alex Wolff, Ann Dowd and Milly Shapiro. Aster starts things off with an unsettling image that sets the tone for most of what's to come. The camera slowly moves in on an elaborate and detailed dollhouse. It's clearly hand-crafted art, and as we get closer, it focuses on one of the bedrooms. Then, quite eerily, the room seamlessly becomes real, with a teen boy waking from his bed. Is this a dream, a metaphor, or the film telling us that the line is going to be very thin between fantasy and reality? Yes, yes, and yes. And the movie only gets better from there. We're introduced to the occupants of the house, starting with dad Steve (Byrne). He's a calm and stoic sort, gently nudging the self-absorbed teen boy Peter (Wolff) to get his clothes on for his grandma's funeral. Younger sister Charlie (Shapiro) isn't ready for the trip to church either. She's an eccentric 13-year-old, sullen and morose. Then there is mother Annie (Colette), a woman so high-strung that she's already sitting in the car ready to go to the church before her children have even awoken. At the funeral, this family's dysfunction is exposed even more. Annie confesses to barely knowing the woman she's eulogizing, and the bitter daughter indicates that she hasn't forgiven her mother for the many years of estrangement. The mercurial mother kept many secrets from her daughter too, and Annie confesses to not knowing any of her mom's friends who show up to mourn. The more and more time we spend with the Grahams, the more we realize just how utterly secretive and strange they all are. Annie is always on edge, sleepwalking, and displaying wild mood swings day and night. Steve seems inert, even cowardly, in his abilities to calm her or control the wildly undisciplined household. Peter keeps to himself to a fault and lies about his affinity for drugs. And Charlie? Well,"
150,GYX_Doc10_Hereditary,GYX_Doc10_Hereditary,GYX,Horror,Negative,Hereditary,"For as long as there have been movies, the marketing for films has always contained more than a hint of hyperbole. With the advent of cinema, audiences were promised sights and experiences they had never known before. Every film student has heard about how some viewers fled in terror when the Lumiere Brothers screened their short film of a train arriving at the station. That word of mouth hucksterism has been a part of advertising for film ever since  made especially more noticeable when it comes to genre entries. Studios and filmmakers have often promised that their horror movies would be the scariest event ever witnessed by people. In the ballyhoo era of William Castle, the filmmaker would boast that people should sign away their rights if they got to frightened or had a heart attack. Even now, when RAW and other modern horror films come out, it's usually accompanied by tales of attendees fainting or throwing up because the movie was just that terrifying. But something has started to transition in film culture, where the hyperbole has left the purview of the filmmakers and now become a large part of the discourse of critics. With an abundance of sites and sources of film criticism and opinion, the pressure is on writers to make a mark and stand out. Such a skew in supply and demand threatens the possibility for subtlety and nuance. If a critic really enjoyed a film, despite some flaws, he now has to LOVE IT, proclaiming it a bold new direction for the medium. If a writer doesn't like something despite some positive elements, she now has to HATE IT and talk about how terrible it is. Those middle ground opinions are fading away as everyone must be the most impassioned to make a dent. And that's not to say that every critic heaping praise or scorn on a movie is disingenuous; but it is a rising concern within discussions about film where only the loudest and hottest of takes make a dent in people's consciousness. As Assistant Editor Mike Vanderbilt likes to say, ""hyperbole hurts horror."" Some writers, hoping to be quoted or retweeted or just make a splash, drum up new releases as the scariest thing ever (or since THE EXORCIST, which is apparently the benchmark); then, when audiences go and discover it's not, or it's not what they were expecting, bad word of mouth spreads about the film as expectations are missed and the experience isn't what they had in mind. This isn't a call for people to be less passionate in their writing, less effusive in their praise, or anything that genuinely reflects how they felt. But it is a strong suggestion that, when it comes to horror specifically, critics try to be more measured in their approaches. This is all a long way of saying that HEREDITARY arrived at SXSW 2018 as one of the most hyped films of the year. Coming off of an incredible reception at the Sundance"

Dont waver, dont bargain; anything short of yes could put you on a fast track to damnation as surely as a broken mirror will bring you seven years of bad luck. Look at what happens to Christine, a very good egg boiled to perfection by circumstance and a lot of good work by Alison Lohman. One bad decision and suddenly director Sam Raimi throws her under the bus of his terrific new horror film, Drag Me to Hell. If youve been worried that Raimis decade spent spinning the Spider-Man web might have caused him to go soft, well stop. The director who gave us the Evil Dead trilogy is back with a vengeance that rivals the one-eyed gypsy I warned you about. With that fire in his belly, Raimis Drag Me to Hell does everything we want a horror film to do: It is fearsomely scary, wickedly funny and diabolically gross, three stomach-churning states that argue for taking a pass on the 10 box of popcorn. Which also makes the movie an excellent economic investment in these tough times. I mention the economy because Raimi has made it an issue at the heart of Drag Me to Hell, in the spirit of campy cultural commentary that good horror can do so well. The director and his brother Ivan began the script 10 years ago before Peter Parkers many tribulations in Spidey tights sidelined it. If the Raimis really are as prescient as Drag Me would suggest, Id like to put in a good word for them to be added to the Obama economic recovery team. You see, Christine is a lending agent at a bank and ambition has made her desperate for a promotion. The gypsy is old Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), who just wants a little of the candy on Christines desk and another extension on her home loan. Sounds reasonable to me. And it did to Christine too until her boss (David Paymer) hints that if she is serious about that promotion . . . So good, decent Christine goes against her better judgment and denies Mrs. Ganushs request. Bad choice, Christine. Before she can begin what will be a long string of Im sorrys, that become How dare yous, theres a curse on her head and the nightmare begins. Not too many scenes later you may find yourself wondering if the title was meant to refer to Christine or the rest of us. Against all the craziness that any decent ghost story conjures up, there has to be the rational voice. In Drag Me, it comes from the Mac guy, Justin Long, who Im sure will one day have a role that will turn his Apple ad stint into nothing more than a footnote, but this wont be it.

That is what it wants to be, and that is what it is. After scaling the heights with A Simple Plan (1998) and slugging a home run with the Spider-Man franchise, its like Sam Raimi is taking some personal time and returning to his hobby. He is greatly assisted by his star, Alison Lohman. Horror movies with nasty old men can be fun (see Bride of Frankenstein), but for the mainline product theres nothing like a sweet and vulnerable girl. Although in real life shes pushing 30, Lohman looks nowhere near old enough to be Christine, the bank loan officer. No wonder she has such a chaste sleep-apart relationship with her boyfriend, Clay Dalton (Justin Long). I suspect they practice abstinence. If Clay Dalton rings a bell, those are surely two of the most common names in movies; there have been 761 Clays and 413 Daltons. Thats the kind of elbow nudge Raimi likes to provide, especially since the character really requires no surname. The whole movie is nudges, especially scenes involving a cute kitten and Shock Reveals. Cute kitties of course are useful in the Its Only a Cat! false alarms, and Raimi deserves praise for not using this kitten in that way. Shock Reveals are of course the moments when a terrifying image explodes from the scene, scaring the split pea soup out of the heroine. Shock Reveals should logically be silent, unless the Revealed is screaming. But in horror films they always come with discordant chords and loud bangs. This is as obligatory as the fact that blades always make a snicker-snack noise even when they are not scraping enough something. It is essential that the heroine (for horror victims are conventionally women) be a good screamer, and man, can that Alison Lohman scream. Stanley Kubrick would have needed only a day with her on The Shining, instead of the weeks he spent with Shelley Duvall. Christine has reason to scream. An old gypsy woman with a blind eye and leprous fingernails asks her for a third extension on her home loan, and if theres one thing Ive learned in this life, its that you never say no to an old gypsy woman with a blind eye and leprous fingernails. In the struggle that follows, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), rips a button off Christines coat, and that leads to no end of bad things, including the very real possibility that (spoiler) Christine will find herself Dragged to Hell. (unspoiler) Mrs. Ganush stalks and threatens her, Christine psyches out at work and with dinner with Clay Daltons parents, and Clay Dalton recruits an Indian-American mystic named Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) to fight on her side. If you think Rham Jas is supposed to be an elbow nudge for the famous Ram Das, you may be on to something. I didnt find any occurrence of Rham Jas, except those citing this movie, in the first 1,000"

When the bank forecloses on an old gypsys house, its the unlucky young loan officer who risks having her soul repossessed in this throwback to both Raimis early work and 50s B-movies. After booking the pic in coveted midnight slots at the SXSW and Cannes fests, Universal should see strong awareness yield heavenly returns. Popular on Variety As its no-nonsense title suggests, Drag Me to Hell offers a kicking-and-screaming riff on the classic curse movie and if the material scarcely warrants feature length, so be it. Scant of plot and barren of subtext, the pic is single-mindedly devoted to pushing the audiences buttons, and who better than Raimi to do the honors? Long before he went legit with A Simple Plan, helmer was perfecting inventive shocks on shoestring budgets, and, as if to remind us of that legacy, he opens this modestly budgeted film (by Spider-Man standards, at least) with an early-80s Universal logo. First scene further cements the tone, as an innocent boy (though not so innocent as to avoid being cursed) attempts to outrun his imminent damnation, only to be thrown from a balcony and swallowed whole by a gaping, fiery chasm in the earth. Its hard to imagine such a fate awaiting Christine (Alison Lohman), a sweet young lady gunning for the assistant manager job at her local bank, until we see the almost comically unkempt old hag who comes begging for an extension on her mortgage. With one bad eye, gnarled fingernails and inexplicably jagged dentures, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) is clearly the reason Raimi and his brother Ivan decided to write this in the first place. Shes as memorable a villain as Christine is forgettable a heroine, and the fact that Mrs. Ganush means bad business is so evident in her introductory scene that the mere appearance of her car (played by Raimis own instantly recognizable 1973 Oldsmobile) in the parking garage is enough to make neck hairs stand on end. On the losing end of a showdown that makes creative use of a stapler and several other everyday office supplies, Mrs. Ganush manages to grab one of Christines buttons and utter a nasty incantation. Soon it will be you who comes begging to me, she predicts. But the crusty old crone expires before Christine can ask her to lift the curse, leaving our hell-bent heroine with no one but her skeptical fiance (Justin Long) and an in-over-his-head street-corner psychic (Dileep Rao) to advise her on how to escape her fate. In the increasingly desperate events that follow, Raimi clearly believes the mouth, not the eyes, are the window to the soul, with one grossout gag after another exploiting auds fear of foreign substances (from ominous flies to Mrs."

So, at long last, here comes the boss to show everyone how its really done. Raimi, of course, made his name in the horror genre with the Evil Dead trilogy. Since then, his careers led him away from scares towards web-covered franchises. After the misfiring Spider-Man 3, Drag Me To Hell is a return to a genre he once ruled in an attempt to blow away the cobwebs. In fact, this is easily the purest Raimi movie since Evil Dead II. Co-written with his brother, Ivan, this is the first Ghost House Pictures movie to live up to the monikers macabre funfair origins, lurching from wild laughs to beautifully choreographed scares like a locomotive threatening to leave the tracks. As with a ghost train, the objective is simple. Build tension. Scream. Reveal scary thing. Scream. Relieve tension. Laugh. And start all over again... Its a formula Raimi milks right from the off and the scene where Mrs. Ganush (a memorable Lorna Raver) places her gypsy curse on Alison Lohmans Christine. An extended scrap in Lohmans car, it starts with a terrific twist on the theres someone in the back seat chestnut, before exploding into a relentless audio-visual onslaught punched through with Raimis pitch-black sense of humour, as Ganush loses her rotting dentures, and turns an intended bite into a slobbery, gruesome parody of a kiss. As the more demented elements of the plot are introduced props for the possessed hankie, a genuine first for a horror movie its clear that, for Raimi, Drag Me To Hell is a release valve for every deranged impulse he couldnt indulge with the Spider-movies. Although there is no message here, the film can be seen as a cautionary tale about the perils of greed, like Raimis A Simple Plan. Christines one slip, her one concession to ambition, is enough to damn her to a horrific ordeal in which Lohman is humiliated and abused in the grand tradition of that other great Raimi lead, Bruce Campbell. In a sense, Raimi has really lucked out with the timing of the films release if ever there was a period when audiences could be expected to enjoy watching a banker suffer, its now. And boy, does Christine suffer. If shes not being slammed into a ceiling by an invisible demonic force, then shes hose-spraying a nosebleed around her office or vomiting up flies at the dinner table. There are other characters in the movie Justin Long, as her earnest boyfriend, and Dileep Lao, as a shaman saviour, are fine but this is undoubtedly Lohmans show, turning in an impressive remember me? performance that should put her back on the map.

If the answer is no, consider the situation in which Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) finds herself. Shes a young, diligent loan officer working in a Los Angeles bank who is hoping to be promoted to Assistant Manager. Her boss (David Paymer) though seems to prefer another colleague: a pushy guy, less talented than her, but much better at hardballing would-be borrowers. Christine resolves to be more like him, to be tougher with people who are behind on payments. And then, almost immediately, into her clean, hushed bank branch hobbles an old lady called Mrs Ganush (Lorna Raver). She has cloudy eyes, nails that look like dirty claws, dentures which she messily takes off to suck on a bowl of sweets. Most importantly, she is poor and is desperate for an extension on her home loan. The old Christine would have been sympathetic to Mrs Ganush. The new Christine is not unsympathetic, but she knows that lending her money would be a big risk. She decides to turn down her application, even when the lady gets on her knees to beg. A sensible if clearly difficult decision, we might think. Would that more bank people behaved as scrupulously. But oh no! Mrs Ganush is starting to froth and wail. Shes really angry. Shes placing a curse on Christine. Its no casual curse either. Soon the young, diligent woman cant go anywhere without loud, scary music starting up. Almost everything she touches gives her the jitters. According to the seer Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) she consults, theres worse to come: her soul is threatened with eternal damnation. Of course this set up is utter hokum. If Mrs Ganush is able to wield so much power, how come she hasnt been able to channel it in a way that will rake in the handful of pesetas she needs? No wonder Raimi quickly cuts to the chase, piling on thrills and gag-worthy images that are delightfully disgusting. The title alone should give us a clue that Raimi and his fellow screenwriter, brother Ivan, arent trying to pander to the kind of moviegoer who only likes horror if its gussied up art-house style, like Let The Right One In. They dont care if Drag Me To Hell is seen as a modern-day B-movie. Their fan-boy base doesnt mind either that this is a very belly picture. Every other scene seems to depict something being ingested or expelled. Usually the latter: a fly lands on Christines face while shes sleeping and crawls around, by her chin and by her lips, until it clambers through her nostrils"

Drag Me to Hell a great genre title for an O.K. genre movie is the latest from Sam Raimi, who made zillions with his Spider-Man movies but is revered by horrorphiliacs for another trilogy, his cheapo-creepo Evil Dead movies. Taking a break from A-movie budgets, subjects and actors, Raimi and his brother Ivan concocted a script about the effects of a gypsy curse on a basically nice person who does One Bad Thing. Inspired by the tone of B-movie scare epics of the '50s, they've made a slick, mostly predictable homage-pastiche that itself rates about a B-. Christine (Matchstick Man's Alison Lohman) is a friendly, efficient, 20-something career gal with a caring, slightly pompous boyfriend (Justin Long, from the Apple commercials), who just got a job as a professor but whose real function in the film is to scoff at the existence of the satanic forces pestering Christine and to be absent or ignorant whenever bad stuff happens. As the loan officer at an L.A. bank, she has to consider a nutsy crone's request for an extension on a home loan. The old lady, a Mrs. Ganush (the aptly named Lorna Raver), doesn't have much collateral: a glass eye, false teeth that keep slipping out and enough phlegm to fill the Rose Bowl. Reluctantly, and to help her secure a promotion, Christine turns down the loan. Apparently, Christine doesn't realize she's in a horror film, where the first law is to avoid pissing off a crazy lady with a wandering eye. That evening after work, in a parking garage that of course has not another soul passing through it for minutes on end, our heroine is attacked by the old lady. At the end of the kind of combat scene Mickey Rourke didn't have to endure in The Wrestler, Mrs. G. snatches a button off Christine's coat and hands it back, with the promise that she'll be hearing from the Lamia. A storefront psychic advisor (Dileep Rao) explains that the Lamia is a demon who toys sadistically with his victims for three days, then pretty much drags them down to Hell. Thus is the logic of horror movies. It's a doctrine that Raimi devoutly observes, he being as old-fashioned a scare maker as the Lady Ganush is an intoner of maledictions. This is the sort of film where the wind portentously rustles leaves only Christine can see moving; where pots and pans rattle on their own; where every door creaks and violins go tremulous in a John Cagean symphony of noises; where nosebleeds reach Niagara volume; where the shadow of a horned, cloven-hoofed creature proceeds up the stairs toward the heroine's bedroom; and where, to get rid of a curse, you must dig"

""""It's by Sam Raimi."""" Perhaps, then, it shouldn't be routinely dismissed as just another tale of demons and ghosts that has been emasculated with the goal of appealing to pimple-faced teenagers who haven't figured out how to sneak into legitimate R-rated features. Raimi, despite having become sidetracked by a certain web-slinging superhero in recent years, has legitimate horror credentials. Not only is his Evil Dead trilogy considered a horror milestone, but he's the only director to have gotten Katie Holmes to doff her top. That alone has to count for something although, had The Gift been rated PG-13, Katie's assets would have remained concealed. So has Raimi achieved the Holy Grail? Has he made a horror film that chills and thrills yet is mild enough to allow admittance to comers of all ages? Sadly, no. But wait... all is not lost. Although Drag Me to Hell mostly fails as horror, it achieves sporadic success as a comedy. The conundrum lies in locating the line of demarcation between intentional and unintentional humor. With Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, Raimi demonstrated that he enjoys spiking his blood and gore with satire, wit, and the Three Stooges. Some of that is in evidence here. Unfortunately, there are also times when the direction and acting are so ham-fisted that intended scares provoke chortles instead of gasps. Even if one shifts mindset and looks at Drag Me to Hell as pure satire, its effectiveness is middling. It feels bloated and overlong and the occasional bursts of laughter don't warrant a 100-minute investment of time. Loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is vying with a co-worker for the vacant position of assistant manager. She needs the promotion not only to secure her future but to impress the parents of her boyfriend, Clay (Justin Long), who think she's not good enough for their son. The bank manager, Mr. Jacks (David Paymer), delights in playing Christine against her rival and watching the sparks fly. One day, a crone with the improbable name of Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) comes to the bank asking for relief from a mortgage she can't pay. She's behind on her payments and is about to lose her house. Mr. Jacks leaves the resolution of the matter to Christine and she decides to take the hard-line to demonstrate her toughness. Mrs. Ganush does not react well to this. A verbal confrontation leads to a physical alteration which culminates in the old woman leveling a curse at Christine's jacket button. Soon thereafter, Christine begins having disturbing visitations by things that go bump in the night, and she solicits the aid of a mystic (Dileep Rao) to rid her of the curse and its associated devil who, after three days of haunting her, will claim her soul and drag her bodily to hell.

It could help alleviate the anger of knowing youve been had.

The only thing hes likely to turn a viewer to this time is the door marked exit. For God only knows what reason, it begins with a prelude staged in 1969 in Pasadena. A kid steals a necklace from a gypsy wagon and takes refuge in one of those old houses that look like W. C. Fields lived there. The doors slam open; people fall to their deaths; the floor opens and sucks the little thief into a cauldron of flames; and the house goes back to looking like a silent-film set. Forty years later, a pretty loan officer in a California bank named Christine Brown (Alison Lohman, sometimes unfairly confused with Lindsay Lohan) refuses to extend a delinquent loan to an ancient hag with one eye and a mouth full of black incisors who has an epileptic fit in the middle of the bank and puts a curse on the young career girl. The nightmare begins. The crone attacks her in the underground parking garage, wrecks her car and rips a button from her coat. Soon she hears the same voices the little boy heard back in 1969. A bug crawls into her nose in the middle of the night. The next day at work she spews blood all over the bank. Her boyfriend (Justin Long) pooh-poohs the whole thing, until she bakes a harvest cake to impress his snobby parents and a human eye pops out of the batter with the kind of ensuing dinner-table chaos that guarantees a short engagement with no need for the bridal registry at Bloomingdales. Seeking the help of a loopy carnival medium, Christine finds herself up to her pierced ears in corpse vomit, animal sacrifice, violent sances and open graves. Nothing stops the curse. The road to deliverance leads to the same old house in Pasadena containing the doorway to hell, but the movie doesnt end there. Theres still a preposterous finale in a grotesque cemetery that tickles the funny bone more than it assaults the nervous system. Sound effects play an important part in the superficial mechanics (pots and pans rattle, glass shatters, powerful forces knock people to the floor), and to Mr. Raimis credit, there is no happy ending. Still, the first rule in spook films is If"
159,IRL_Doc9_DragmetoHell,IRL_Doc9_DragmetoHell,IRL,Horror,Negative,DragmetoHell,"Sam Raimis self-styled spook-a-blast brand of horror-comedy, which is said to be inspired by those cheapo carnival rides that alternately jerk patrons around in pitch dark and attempt to menace them with generic, cheesy ghouls, is best exemplified by the latter two Evil Dead films and his latest. A giddy procession of intermittently successful jump scares and make-you-vomit sight gags strung together by a story so elemental it could be rendered in mural form on a funhouse wall, Drag Me to Hell is a cheerfully childish piece of horror, devoid of dread and uninterested in suffering, motivated instead by an impish desire to inflict innocuous, seat-buzzer-level scares that leave no lingering unsettlement as they evaporate. The films vehicle for these plentiful one-off jolts, which are invariably accompanied by loud-as-possible music cues, is a curse that manifests itself as a poltergeist and is figuratively hung around the neck of Christine (Alison Lohman), a so-innocent-she-lisps bank loan officer whose momentary betrayal of her own bleeding-heart ethics lands her on the shit list of an elderly gypsy customer, Mrs. Ganush (a sufficiently despicable Lorna Raver). Under pressure to keep pace with a brown-nosing colleague (Reggie Lee) angling for her rightful promotion, Christine denies Ganushs third mortgage extension, a fateful mistake she immediately compounds by screaming for help when Ganush collapses in a fit of hem-grabbing beggary. For the sin of shaming a proud woman, Christine is cursed to be targeted by the Lamia, a goat-demon from hell with a three-day taunting program that includes clomping its hooves within earshot, generating indoor wind gusts strong enough to send the victim crashing into furniture, and ultimately erupting from the earth to drag the accursed down, a succinct demonstration of which is given in the films bold prologue. To combat the Lamia, Christine enlists the services of Platinum card-accepting psychic Rham (Dileep Rao, being unnecessarily dour) and relies on emotional support from skeptical boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) while she gradually sheds the mousy navete evinced by her early scenes to arrive as a more confident, self-actualizing heroine who is believably desperate for survival, a characteristic best conveyed in a hilarious, well-timed scene involving a kitchen knife that rebuts the assertion of her boss (David Paymer) that she may not be able to make the tough decisions. Unfortunately, cleverly executed scenes prove surprisingly rare in Raimis film, which tends to eschew earned shocks and carefully balanced setups and payoffs in favor of a surfeit of standalone, maximum gross-out gags, such as a projectile nose-bleeding moment and a mouth-full-of-maggots episode; these occurrences seem more like the kind of thing destined to be nominated for MTV Movie Awards than the sophisticated mlange of high tension and cartoony asides seen in the directors better films like Darkman, with which this bears some passing similarity in its boulder-rolling-downhill momentum and fondness for destructive mayhem. The plentiful bodily-fluid spills and prankish, pop-up shocks in Drag Me to Hell are more on-the-nose than weve come to expect from our Tex Avery of kinetic"

In Drag Me to Hell, his heroinevictim is Alison Lohman, a loans officer at a Los Angeles bank. With a promotion in the offing, she's keen to convince her boss that her soft-hearted sweetness won't stop her making tough decisions. So when a toothless crone begs her for a mortgage extension, Lohman refuses, even though said crone is just a cat and a broomstick away from being an archetypal witch. Overreacting somewhat, this dissatisfied customer summons a demonic spirit to harass Lohman for three days before, yes, dragging her to Hell. The film shares its plot with The Unborn, which came out in February, but with one key difference: The Unborn didn't realise how daft it was, whereas Drag Me to Hell has the knockabout tone of a Tom Jerry cartoon (or rather The Simpsons' gory Tom Jerry pastiche, Itchy Scratchy). There are no Wikipedia gobbets about ancient Jewish texts or Nazi eugenics here. From its title onwards, Drag Me to Hell revels in its Hallowe'en hokeyness, sticking to the hoariest of horror standbys (seances, storm-racked graveyards) and turning them all into the stuff of gross-out comedy. This is a film in which the charmingly straight-faced heroine has an anvil suspended from a pulley in her garage, just in case she needs to cut the rope and squish anyone who happens to be standing directly beneath it. It's a treat for those of us who don't like our horror to be too horrifying. There's not much in Drag Me to Hell to give anyone nightmares, but as eyeballs fly across the room, and witches spew tidal waves of insects, there are plenty of moments which will have the whole cinema squealing in revolted delight. The only problem is that there's not much going on in between those moments. Each exuberant set piece is like a spin on a roller coaster, but the rudimentary story and dialogue are like the queues you have to stand in before the next ride. Raimi and his brother Ivan must have knocked out their bare-bones script over the course of a long weekend. There's still half an hour of tremendous fun to be had, but Drag Me to Hell is ultimately a quick, trashy B-movie, rather than the unhinged masterpiece that Evil Dead fans were crossing their fingers for. Considering that Raimi has now started work on Spider-Man 4, it could have been subtitled """"What I Did on My Summer Holidays"""".

The lonely Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) knows this all too well in Fresh. Mimi Cave's directorial debut shadows a cynical twenty-something as she bounces from one disappointing date to another. However, being randomly picked up by a handsome surgeon at the grocery store seems like Noa's luck is finally changing. Unfortunately for her, it's not for the better. As far as Noa can tell, Steve (Sebastian Stan) is a total catch. Her best friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs) is naturally suspicious of everyone, but her instincts might be right in this case. Steve's peculiarities  for example, him having no online presence  can be interpreted as flaws. Maybe even red flags. For someone like Noa, though, she simply wants to be wanted. It's only understandable she looks the other way. Everyone watching, on the other hand, is waiting for the other shoe to drop. Cave and writer Lauryn Kahn are not looking to undermine the audience's expectations here. They've set up everything according to genre regulations and not following up on those foreshadowing moments would be foolish and not to mention a waste of time. It also would have been easy  but agonizing  to draw things out. More pleasing than not, Fresh reveals its hand earlier than anticipated. Knowing the truth doesn't lessen the revelation's impact or remove tension, either. That level of shock regarding that plot turn will vary from person to person. Some people are simply more prepared to assume the worst. Fresh is wise to speed through the formalities of these kinds of thrillers and get straight to the meat of the predicament. This leaves room for more engaging storytelling rather than working overtime to uphold the current mystery. Instead, there is a reasonably good amount of suspenseful interactions between the two opposing characters. Noa is never written to be a victim who lacks agency in her situation. Even when she's down for a spell, Noa is always thinking of how she can help herself. The filmmakers of Fresh have a considerable deal of respect for their protagonist in spite of the misfortune they've subjected her to. Steve's unsavoriness is digestible thanks to Stan's devilish charm, but not to the point where it feels like the film wants him to get away with his wrongdoing. Now if only Mollie and another supporting character, Paul (Dayo Okeniyi), had been afforded the same care as the leads. There are too many times where they are less authentic than their peers. It's unclear if something like Fresh will have a long shelf life. Although, it does well not to dwell on the technological aspects of the modern dating scene. The writing is never offensively straightforward either, yet there are times the script veers toward middle-of-the-road in the face of such an unusual premise and outcome. Still, there are plenty of times where this feels like the jewel in"
162,IZL_Doc2_Fresh,IZL_Doc2_Fresh,IZL,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"In fact, the first 38 minutes of the film are really effective, because they feel like the calm before the storm: tension is created so well that, even if we have an idea of what's about to happen, it's still incredibly rewarding to watch the story unfold. Yet, paradoxically, those 38 minutes are the best part of the film, as what happens next, after a delightfully creepy, retro title sequence that plays to the unsettling tune of Joe Meek and the Blue Men's ""I Hear a New World,"" is a blend of tired tropes and cliches that prevent the film from taking its great premise anywhere new. As the title already gives away, Steve's ""unusual appetites"" have to do with human flesh, and he intends to make Noa his next victim. As we see Steve reveal his true self and Noa become more and more aware of how much danger she's in, two things happen. On one hand, we're mesmerized by Sebastian Stan's performance; on the other hand, all the situations that should have been scary and tension-inducing become not only extremely predictable, but also kind of laughable. But let's start from the positives. The role of Steve seems to have been tailor-made for Sebastian Stan: if our psychotic cannibal is already creepy enough at the beginning of the film, when he's smiling and poised, he soon becomes even more disturbing when he reveals his true colours, taking on a different accent and tone of voice and making us shiver by being not only violent and unstable, but also soft-spoken and honest  often at the same time. There are scenes of him dancing and singing along to 1980s tunes that will have your eyes glued to the screen by the sheer absurdity of it all, and it's thanks to Stan that Steve is so captivating even if not much has been done in terms of character development to make his storyline as ""fresh"" as the film's title. As Steve's unwitting yet resourceful victim, Noa is also compelling, and it's thanks to the incredible emotional range conveyed by Daisy Edgar-Jones that her character is always believable, even in the most unlikely scenarios. Unfortunately, the film's biggest flaw resides in its screenplay (Lauryn Kahn, of Ibiza), as FRESH misses the chance to develop its intriguing premise into something new and original, opting instead for safe choices and familiar tropes. The predicament Noa is in should be anxiety-inducing, but there's a point where it all becomes kind of laughable because of how grotesque and predictable it all is, so much so that Noa and Steve themselves become caricatures instead of fully-fledged characters. There's an investigative element to it which mostly involves Noa's best friend Molly, but besides being predictable as well, it also verges into strong/sassy Black woman trope territory at points. There's a twist involving Steve's identity that could have really changed the tone of the film, but doesn't. Some of the film's dynamics should remind us of anything from horror"
163,IZL_Doc3_Fresh,IZL_Doc3_Fresh,IZL,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"The creepiest moments in Mimi Cave's thriller Fresh are rooted in the familiar. These moments are creepier not in spite of their everyday banality, but because of it. Daisy Edgar-Jones plays a young woman navigating the dystopia that is modern dating. Like any young woman, she has become used to the idea that the onus is on her to stay on guard. Walking alone in a dark alleyway, she keeps her car key in a ready-to-jab position when she thinks she is being followed. A guy on a dating app responds to her comment on his cute cat pic with an unsolicited dick pic. The panic is writ large on her face when she can't get any bars on her phone. If women are terrified of walking home alone at night or losing cell phone reception, it is due to the sinister forces that lurk in the darkness. The forces don't get more sinister than in Cave's debut feature, which stirs up a batch of stew from the leftovers of American Psycho and _You_ and calls it Fresh. Marinating the film is a touch of her own creative sadism. The gristle is its conceit of how women are commodified. As the film marches on, some succumb to the commodification, one joins in, and the rest figure out a way to overcome it  and survive. Online dating isn't working out for Noa (Edgar-Jones). Just when she is about to resign herself to a life of quiet solitude, she runs into handsome plastic surgeon Steve (Sebastian Stan) at the supermarket. They flirt over cotton-candy grapes, he makes some excuse to get her number, they bond over dead parents on the first date, and soon he is whisking her off on a getaway. If there is a red flag, it's that he has no social media presence and can't be found on Google. Noa's best friend Mollie (Jonica T Gibbs) voices some concern, but Noa writes it off as Steve favouring the old-fashioned ways just as much as he does his Old Fashioneds. After a half-an-hour or so is when the opening credits pop up to reveal what we're watching is in fact a horror movie. The romance, like many of the beloved entries of the genre, was to wear down the woman's defences till she gave in. Steve was playing a long con  and not for the first time, as Noa soon realises. A whole network of rich, powerful men (let's call them the patriarchy) depend on him to cater to their very particular appetite. To go into any more detail will only ruin the movie. Despite the swerves, there is little doubt over how the story will pan out, or the ostensible catharsis of its inevitable conclusion. Shape-shifting between sweet and sinister with a mere smile, Stan captures the insidiousness of a practiced deceiver who knows how to weaponise his disarming charm.When he calmly reveals Noa of her fate and loses his temper over her reaction, we witness the"
164,IZL_Doc4_Fresh,IZL_Doc4_Fresh,IZL,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"Fresh plays out like director Mimi Cave (primarily known for shorts and music videos, making her feature-length debut) and screenwriter Lauryn Kahn (also experienced with shorts, although with a feature-length script already to her name) are ready to burn down the entire enterprise of online dating. To be fair, given stranger than fiction documentaries like The Tinder Swindler readily available on Netflix and no doubt a plethora of negative personal experiences to pull from, there's also nothing wrong with taking that system down a peg, especially when it comes to the swaths of undesirable men outnumbering women on the various social applications. That part is well-intentioned. However, Fresh gets so far stuck up its ass that a final punchline zinger comes across like victim shaming. It seems to be saying that this abusive situation would have never developed had the heroine decided to go on another date with an unmannered, offputting douche. One could also go a step further and take it as saying straight hopeful romantic women clinging onto the prospect of finding something sincere and wonderful and meaningful should give up because heterosexual dating is only a bunch of Chads, which is the gross date character's name because that's how unsubtle the jokes are here. More to the point, fuck that; I have my own unflattering stories of using online dating services, but I've also gotten to know some incredible people there I still regularly talk to. Let's meet the movie halfway; my personal feelings offset whatever the filmmakers are serving up. Fresh is amateurishly written, filled with convenient writing, plot inconsistencies, illogical character motivations, and most offensively, considering this is first and foremost a social commentary horror movie, rarely elicits dread. This is explored through cannibalism (there is also no point beating around the bush, considering the advertising is heavily selling Fresh this way). Daisy Edgar-Jones' Noa takes a break from online dating to pursue a grocery aisle meet-cute with awkwardly charming and handsome plastic surgeon Steve (Sebastian Stan). So maybe the regressive message is also not to take a chance on attractive people? Anyway, Fresh does take its time building a believable connection between these two while using Noa's desire for romance as a crutch for letting her guard down and making some unwise decisions that her friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs, saddled with a disappointing nothing role of a cautiously supportive Black friend that attempts to save the day when shit goes south) advises against. Nevertheless, for the most part, the honeymoon phase between Noa and Steve is used smartly, crescendoing with a black comedy title card drop signifying the end of act one and the descent into sadistic danger. There is no denying that Steve has some twisted motives. That also doesn't mean Fresh follows through on any of it, evoking tension or terror. If anything, the proceedings become borderline comical and absurd; the flesh is removed (and in some cases, limbs), but characters remain largely functional and alert. At one point, a character"
165,IZL_Doc5_Fresh,IZL_Doc5_Fresh,IZL,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"Modern dating can make a girl feel like a real slab of meat  at least, that's the central thesis of Mimi Cave's debut Fresh, a horror-comedy with its teeth filed down to stubs. ""Hopefully, this'll make for a good story,"" Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) tells her BFF Mollie (Jojo T Gibbs) before she heads off on a date with the most blandly vile man you can imagine: he monologues about acid reflux, tells her she'd look prettier in a dress, spouts some racism at their waiter, and then calls Noa a ""bitch"" when she doesn't want to kiss him. When Noa gets back home, she tries to message another guy. He immediately responds with a dick pic. So who could blame her for ignoring every red flag presented by Steve (Sebastian Stan), who approaches her in a grocery store and jokes about how cotton candy grapes really do taste like cotton candy. Steve seems all too perfect: he loves to dance in the middle of his living room, he doesn't want to rush into sex, and he isn't on social media (which the film treats as immediately suspect, but I would argue is the romantic ideal). Noa complains that dating reduces us all to ""the perfect projection"", but she's just as willing to play into romcom fantasy: she's a ""pancakes out of a bag"" kind of girl, he's a sophisticated cocktail connoisseur. As Mollie points out: ""It's a straight girl's fantasy come true!"" It's a very relatable sort of hypocrisy. And when Steve whisks Noa away for a weekend out in nature, we're meant to read it as passionate and spontaneous  right up to the moment the film's title belatedly drops, around half an hour in, and we find out that he's actually a cannibal. Not a hobbyist cannibal, mind you, but a professional one, carving up women for wealthy clients while keeping them chained in his basement so the meat stays fresh. But Cave's film proves that there's a clear difference between clever metaphors and satisfying ones. The way Steve looks Noa dead in the eyes and says ""I'm taking your ass"" is a very dark but funny joke. And Cave, certainly, leans into the film's tongue-in-cheek quality. Fresh is shot by cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski, known for his work on both Hereditary and Midsommar, and the camera lurches around Steve's mid-century basement dungeon (quite nice if you take it out of context) in queasy disbelief at what's going on. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Steve is carving up body parts  for human meatballs and human prosciutto  while dancing to Peter Cetera's ""Restless Heart"". In another scene, he trudges into Noa's room, whining about how exhausting it is to chop up women all day. Stan has clearly been directed to give us Patrick Bateman with a Hannibal Lecter garnish, and it's effective for what it is. But Bateman  of Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho  always represented a somewhat outsized vision of male narcissism, and Fresh can't"
166,IZL_Doc6_Fresh,IZL_Doc6_Fresh,IZL,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"Dating in the 21st-century sucks. From traversing the hellscape of apps like Tinder and Hinge to dealing with ghosting, catfishing, and game-playing, it's a minefield of frustration for anyone looking for love in all the wrong places. Even when you meet someone who seems normal, there's always that nagging thought in the back of your head that something isn't right. And then a twisted film like Fresh comes along to perfectly encapsulate the dangers and disasters of the dating world. It's hard to talk about something like Fresh without entering spoiler territory. How Searchlight Pictures/Hulu will ultimately market this film is anyone's guess. The story centres on Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones), a twentysomething Los Angelino who is exhausted by a barrage of disappointing dates. Everything appears to change when Noa experiences a chance encounter at the supermarket with the charming and slightly goofy Steve (Sebastian Stan). As their relationship blossoms at a surprising speed, Steve invites Noa for a romantic weekend away...and that's when this film becomes something else entirely. In her stellar directorial debut, Mimi Cave brings Lauryn Kahn's astute screenplay to life in terrific style. A sharp critique of the horrors of modern dating and a clever allegory for the exploitation of women's bodies, Fresh is a deliciously nasty treat. There will be inevitable comparisons to Emerald Fennell's Promising Young Woman, given this film also gleefully blurs the lines between romantic comedy and revenge horror. If you enjoyed what Fennell had to say about toxic masculinity, you'll love what Cave and Kahn serve up. It's around the 40-minute mark the penny drops as to what direction Cave is taking this film and there's really no looking back from there. Stan and Edgar-Jones both knock it out of the park. Their initial chemistry is warm and engaging, but that quickly dissolves when the sinister elements of Kahn's screenplay are unveiled. Edgar-Jones refuses to play Noa as the typical damsel in distress archetype this genre said goodbye to years ago. She's incredibly wily and rejects the inevitable fate that appears inescapable. As it turns out, Noa is as equally adept at manipulation as her oppressor and it's a joy to watch Edgar-Jones delve into Noa's layers. It's hard to discuss Stan's performance without ruining the sociopathic surprises Steve has up his sleeve. Let's just say Stan plays with light and shade in ways we've never seen from him before. There's always something so refreshing about a film that takes familiar genre tropes and twists them out of shape to create a piece of cinema that feels entirely new. Fresh is appropriately titled. It's an ambitious undertaking by a first-time director, but Cave nails it. If you're feeling low on being single, this film might just make you appreciate your marital status. And it may just have you second-guessing the handsome stranger in the grocery aisle."
167,IZL_Doc7_Fresh,IZL_Doc7_Fresh,IZL,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"The film opens with a vignette depicting what appears to be a worst-case first-date scenario: Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) meets Chad (Brett Dier) for dinner at a Chinese restaurant, where he talks about his acid reflux, criticizes her clothing and her appearance, makes her pay for both their meals, and commandeers her leftovers for himself. It goes downhill from there  but, at least Chad's unpleasantness never amounts to anything more than the whiny chauvinism of a malcontent deadbeat. After discussing the pitfalls of dating apps with her friend Mollie (Jonica T. Gibbs), Noa has a chance meeting with Steve (Sebastian Stan) at a grocery store. She finds his awkward humor charming, and he convinces her to give him her number. They connect over the course of a few dates, and Steve invites her to run off with him for a romantic weekend getaway. The destination, he tells her, is a surprise. Red flag, anyone? This is where ""Fresh"" does something that's  well, fresh. Up until this point, approximately 30 minutes into the film, the script could have been heading in a number of different directions. Comedy, romance, drama  any one of these paths could have been possible. Shortly after Noa and Steve arrive at their destination, the bottom drops out and, around the 33-minute mark, the film's opening credits appear onscreen. What transpires over the remaining 80 minutes of running time is a provocative, grotesque feast of decadence and an attack on entitlement. Going into too much detail would spoil the film's puzzles, so I'll only provide as much information as the studio supplies in its official synopsis: Noa discovers ""her new paramour has been hiding some unusual appetites."" While the story may not be entirely original, the way Cave presents it certainly feels jarringly inventive. Despite the macabre subject matter, ""Fresh"" often employs wickedly depraved humor and sporadically shifts tone, moving from the ghastly to the absurd in a heartbeat. Cave shrewdly misleads, subverts and destabilizes: She utterly macerates audience expectations and topples a few sacred cows along the way. Her feminist approach is neither preachy nor self-righteous, though the film takes its time revealing a single male character who isn't awful. The vigilant viewer will spot more than one occasion in which Noa does something particularly rash or irresponsible. She is not immune to making bad decisions that exacerbate the dilemma. Edgar-Jones plays the complex part exceedingly well, particularly considering the fact that she must fluctuate between fawning lover and tenacious survivor. Stan's portrayal of Steve is unnerving and sinister. Even during the first 30 minutes of setup and misdirection, Stan manages to slip in traces of loathsomeness beneath Steve's swagger and charm. ""Fresh"" is a stylish, uncompromising, and surprisingly artistic depiction of endemic exploitation, the ubiquity of toxic masculinity, and perseverance. It is twisted and unsettling, and equally capable of eliciting a smile and a laugh as well as a wince and a shudder. Certainly not meant for the squeamish, ""Fresh"" is a transgressive treat"
168,IZL_Doc8_Fresh,IZL_Doc8_Fresh,IZL,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"The Midnight selection at Sundance 2022 kicked off with Fresh, a cautionary tale about the (sometimes literal) horrors of the modern dating world. Daisy Edgar-Jones got her breakout role with the BBC adaptation of best-selling novel Normal People in 2020, but her 2022 begins with a search for love  and the people she meets on the way are anything but normal. Stuck in an endless loop of bad online dates, it comes as an almighty relief when Noa (Edgar-Jones) has an old-school meat cute... sorry, meet cute in the grocery aisle of her local supermarket. Steve (Sebastian Stan) is handsome and seems nice, charming and slightly goofy. Most importantly though, he's refreshingly normal. Sure, there are a few red flags (who doesn't have a social media presence in 2022?), but nothing significant enough to be a deal breaker. It's said said that you never really know a partner until you've been on holiday together; so when Steve whisks Noa away for a romantic weekend, she jumps at the chance to get to know the ""real"" Steve, away from the monotonous day-to-day. To quote another timeless love story, his ""desires are... unconventional"". The exact nature of those desires are too delicious to spoil but audiences, much like Noa, will need a strong stomach. Stan attacks the role of Steve with great relish. He begins smooth and charming but, once his mask slips, morphs into someone else entirely. His manipulation and abuse of Noa is all done with the unwavering belief that he is ""a good guy"". That he really does care for her and she'll be fine as long as she behaves. Just like Fresh, Stan effortlessly walks the line between light and dark, humour and horror. Meanwhile, Edgar-Jones' Noa is proof that Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, ghosted or catfished! The actress also proves herself more than up to the task of leading the thriller, possessing a steeliness and unshakable resolve that's well-concealed beneath her unassuming exterior.Courtesy of Sundance Institute In her feature directorial debut, Mimi Cave is not afraid to misbehave and make some bold directorial choices  for instance, the opening credits don't kick in until the 30-minute mark. Cave begins with a self-assured, less is more approach to the storytelling and character development, allowing audiences to imagine terrors far worse than she could depict on screen, before dialling it up to eleven for a cathartic climax. The oeuvre of female directors in horror has truly blossomed over the last couple of years with the likes of Rose Glass, Prano Bailey-Bond and Julia Ducournau. Mimi Cave looks set to join their ranks on the strength of this film, cooking up a storm from Lauryn Kahn's razor sharp screenplay. Fresh is wild, wicked and deliciously entertaining. Just don't see it on a first date, or else there likely won't be a second."
169,IZL_Doc9_Fresh,IZL_Doc9_Fresh,IZL,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"From the outset there's an irreverent tone to Fresh that infers the casual callousness that is the dating scene. It's perfectly reflective of how easily dating can be an unhinged hellscape despite the supposed ""safeguards"" of the modern-era. Cave sets the stage with a thirty-seven minute opening that's a eye-twitch inducing reminder of exactly how quickly a date can go from neutral to noxious. She doesn't have to reach far for stories of meet-ups gone awry, from kidnappers and craigslist-killers to hoteps and himbos, the anecdotes abound. Wanting to connect, romantically, with another person pushes people to take all kinds of risks. Even people who otherwise happily self-contained put themselves out there hoping to find love. There's always an inherent danger to making yourself vulnerable; you might end up alone and heartbroken. But for women, dating also carries with it the very real possibility of physical harm. It's downward spiral of harrowing what-ifs and nightmare fuel. Fresh builds a delightfully nuanced commentary out of the vagaries of that particular social paranoia. Girl (Noa) meets boy (Steve). Boy doesn't come off like a creeper. One night of sparks convinces girl to drop her guard. If that sounds like the moment when you realize this woman may just be ignoring those ""he's too good to be true"" red flags and careening towards the land of ""too stupid to live"" then, you've discover the secret sauce that makes the darkly satirical heart of Fresh beat. As a character, Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) feels more like a composite of bad dating moves, misdirected cynicism, and the hard-to-kill hopefulness of singledom. She's narrowly developed. So narrowly that her emotional thinness begins to feel deliberate. She's cynical and defensive; so self-contained getting a bead on what makes her tick practically impossible. There's surface effort given to showing her as not utterly unlovable. She does, after all, have a ride or die bestie. But for the latter half of the story, it's like Noa, as the person, is less important than the inexhaustible supply of women seeking romantic love she represents. Her feelings and thoughts ultimately mattering less than her body and Steve's desire to possess it and her. Steve, however, quickly comes into sharper focus. First as the too-goo-to-be true man Nao drops her guard enough to let get in there and then as turncoat and villain. The film's lifecycle will be tragically familiar to many, long before the story goes all the way left. Sebastian Stan draws the eye and holds your attention. You may just find yourself investing more in Steve and the hints at his backstory and life. If so its because his life and off-putting decisions come to vibrant if murky life far more than Nao ever does.

170,IZL_Doc10_Fresh,IZL_Doc10_Fresh,IZL,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"Mimi Cave's debut feature Fresh sits in a tricky sort of niche where part of its appeal is the unexpected direction its story takes, but where discussion of that direction will inevitably give away some of its secrets. Even by mentioning this shift the damage has partly been done, since readers will now be aware that the film is not quite what it originally purports to be. It is the price we all have to pay, I suppose, since I think it would be irresponsible to let people start the film confidently expecting a romantic comedy and suddenly finding themselves watching a deeply queasy horror film instead. If I have spoiled things for you, I apologise, but trust that if you finish reading at the end of the next sentence I have spoiled far less that Fresh's own promotion and advertising has. It's a great little film, and you should endeavour to give it a shot. Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is sick of the dating scene: the awkward dinners, swiping left and right on dating apps, and particularly the unsolicited 'dick pics'. A chance encounter in a supermarket introduces her to Steve (Sebastian Stan), a charismatic doctor that seems just the antidote to her dating blues. The first half hour of Fresh really does feel like an energised and knowing reset of the romantic comedy. It boasts a tremendous female perspective on male behaviour  both in person and online  and very effectively showcases the challenges women face on a seemingly daily basis. It spikes the stereotypes, and allows a fresh sort of cheerful cynicism to keep it light but relevant. There is a warmth to the characters that makes it a very easy watch. Then it starts to instinctively feel wrong, and untrustworthy. Alarm bells sound in the mind as mixed behaviours build a growing sense of paranoia. By the time it is obvious that Noa is in trouble it is too late to escape, and Fresh slides into an entirely new vibe. Fresh is stylishly produced, with a rich aesthetic that deliberately straddles the line between luxurious and nauseating. This sickly-sweet environment plays host to two excellent lead performances from Edgar-Jones and Stan. They embrace the film's often absurd developments, and go a long way in convincing the audience to accept a fairly unlikely situation. There is strong supporting work here too: chiefly from Dayo Okeniyi as the amusing bartender Paul and particularly Jonica T. Gibbs as Noa's enterprising best friend Millie. It isn't perfect. For one thing the third act rather feels like Cave and screenwriter Lauryn Kahn gave up on juggling all of the narrative balls and simply threw them in the air and ran away. This is particularly true when it comes to the character of Ann (Charlotte Le Bon), whose role in the narrative is set up with intrigue but abandoned in a panic. The film's overarching themes also feel very slightly underdeveloped. Then there is the problem of violence: the jump between genres"

The modern visual rules for these shots were set by Stanley Kubrick's ""2001,"" which used a detailed model moving slowly instead of a cheesy model moving fast. Kubrick had the good sense to know that sound does not travel in space, but ""Star Wars,"" with its deep bass rumbles, demonstrated that it certainly should. And then in the ""Alien"" and ""Star Trek"" pictures and in countless others, gigantic space cruisers aimed majestically at the stars, and I felt an inner delight that has its origins in those long-ago days when I devoured pulp space opera by Robert Heinlein and such forgotten masters as Murray Leinster and Eric Frank Russell. My state of mind is best captured by a pulp mag that was defunct even before I started reading science fiction: ""Thrilling Wonder Stories,"" without doubt the best title in the history of magazines. I hope for strange and amazing adventures. Sometimes I am gratified. More often I am disappointed. ""Pitch Black,"" which begins in deep space and ends with a manhunt on a desert planet, falls somewhere in between: clever, done with skill, yet lacking in the cerebral imagination of the best science fiction. How sad it is that humans travel countless light years away from Earth, only to find themselves inhabiting the same tired generic conventions. The movie begins during an interstellar mission, with the crew and a dangerous prisoner all in cryo-sleep. The ship collides with a cluster of rock fragments, which penetrate the hull like BBs through cellophane. The captain and several other sleepers are terminally perforated, and Fry (Radha Mitchell) assumes command. The ship crash-lands on a planet that circles somehow within a three-star system, where at least one sun never seems to set, and the surviving crew members have to fight it out with the vicious and cunning prisoner Riddick (Vin Diesel). You may remember Diesel from ""Saving Private Ryan,"" where he was the hard-bitten Pvt. Caparzo. He looks like a mean customer, and he is. He shares no fellow feeling with the other survivors, expresses no responsibility to them, does not consider himself in the same boat and thinks only of escaping. Oh, and his eyes have a remarkable quality: He can see in the dark. Not a very useful ability on a planet with three suns and no night, right? (Hollow laugh.) What disappointed me about ""Pitch Black,"" directed by David Twohy, is that it didn't do more with its alien world, and less with its recycled human conflicts. I feel underwhelmed when humans land on another world and are so quickly reduced to jumping out from behind rocks at one another and playing hostage games. ""Pitch Black"" does have a nice look, all bleached blues and desert sands. And there are some promising story elements, one of which I am about to discuss, so you might want to set this review aside if you plan to see the"

On a practical level, I decided to bend the rules because ""Pitch Black"" was a film that I got on DVD ages ago but never actually got round to watching, so I was curious about it. On an intellectual level, I mostly consider ""1990s-style"" films to be ones made in the time between 1989 and 2001 (eg: between the fall of the Berlin Wall and 9/11). So, this review is within the spirit of this series, if not the letter. So, pointless justifications aside, let's take a look at ""Pitch Black"". This review may contain some mild SPOILERS, and I should also warn you that this film contains FLICKERING LIGHTS during an early part of the film (although I don't know if they're fast/intense enough to cause problems). ""Pitch Black"" begins with a spaceship that is transporting cargo and forty passengers (in suspended animation) that is struck by micro-meteorites. The ship's emergency systems kick in and rouse a pilot and one of the officers from cryosleep, but the captain has been struck by one of the meteorites. Struggling to control the ship, the pilot suggests jettisoning the passengers, but the officer won't allow it. So, spotting a habitable desert planet nearby, the pilot makes a dangerous crash landing and manages to save some of the passengers. However, one of the survivors is a dangerous convict called Riddick (played by Vin Diesel) who soon escapes into the desert. The man who is supposed to be guarding him insists that the survivors hunt him down before he attacks them. However, during the search, one of the survivors finds an underground cave system... and is promptly eaten by something. When Riddick is captured, the survivors initially accuse him of murdering the dead survivor but, after one of them explores the caves and is nearly eaten by a creature, they soon realise that having someone as tough as Riddick on their side might not be a bad idea  especially since he's even got night-vision implants in his eyes. A while later, the survivors stumble across an abandoned geological station, whose inhabitants disappeared 22 years earlier. Whilst several of the survivors work out how to get the station's spacecraft working again, the pilot uses an nearby orrery to calculate that there was a solar eclipse 22 years ago. Another encounter with the creatures in the station's drilling room also teaches the survivors that light is harmful to the creatures. Still, the station's space shuttle just needs new power cells. So, it's a simple matter of lugging the cells from the cargo ship's wreckage to the geological station. I mean, what could possibly go wrong.... One of the first things that I will say about ""Pitch Black"" is that it reminded me a lot of both"

I watched this decently entertaining 2000 cult classic that launched Vin Diesel's career. Before he became the Fast and the Furious, Vin Diesel lent his gravel-voiced charisma to this small-budget flick, playing Riddick, a dangerous criminal transported onboard a spaceship along with a bunch of regular passengers. When space debris rupture the ship hull and kill the captain, docking pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) assumes the command and manages to crash land the ship on a nearby planet, though most of the crew and passengers die in the impact. The planet appears to be a giant lifeless wasteland, with not one, not two, but three suns, which keep it in perpetual daylight. The remaining survivors, which include a shady law enforcement officer, a quirky merchant, a Muslim preacher with three young sons, an annoying teenager and a couple of prospectors, make a series of discoveries. Bad: Riddick has escaped soon after the crash. Good: they find an abandoned base with water supplies and a ship that they can repair. Very Bad: the planet is infested with vicious light-sensitive creatures, who dwell underground but come out to party during a total eclipse that plunges the world into impenetrable darkness. And wouldn't you know, another total eclipse is imminent. This leads to a series of predictable tensions and interpersonal conflicts where the group must learn to trust Riddick, who in addition to being the biggest toughest badass of the lot also has surgically enhanced eyes that allow him to see in the dark. And of course it's a game of who-dies-next, as the survivors are picked and munched on one by one. Visually Pitch Black feels dated in the way a lot of the late 90s/early 2000s movies do, with the flashy editing, angles and zooms that must have seemed oh-so cool and edgy twenty years ago but didn't age so well. The earlier daylight scenes pile on the colour grading that made me think of someone who's just discovered filters in Photoshop and couldn't wait to use them all. While the acting is decent, most of the characters don't rise above the stock sci-fi horror types who are mostly there to be the next alien snack, and some attempts at snappy one-liners are facepalm-worthy. On the positive side, though the design of the alien critters is hardly original, the special effects hold up okay, helped no doubt by the minimal lighting. There are some genuinely suspenseful scenes as the group make their way through the total planet-wide darkness, armed with as many sources of light as they can scrounge. One of the survivors has a personal secret I definitely didn't see coming, and though you can smell some sort of redemption story happening from a mile away, it doesn't pan out quite in the way I expected. Vin Diesel's muscular anti-hero role may not demand much of him, but he is enormously watchable and entertaining, while Radha Mitchell makes an impression as a"
174,JMZ_Doc4_Pitch_black,JMZ_Doc4_Pitch_black,JMZ,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch_black,"Bearing the hallmarks of the low-budget science fiction thriller (deserted locations, hidden alien enemies, squabbling characters), Pitch Black (2000) may have used up its fair share of Alien (1979) franchise derivatives, but added a few original twists of its own to the format. In the introduction to his screenplay director David Twohy wrote: ""The creatures in Pitch Black are seldom seen at length. Rather, they are glimpsed, they are heard, they are felt. They are really the embodiment of your nocturnal fears. A howling coyote that jars you awake, the painting on the wall that comes to life when stared at too long, the sway of your bed just before the earthquake hits. Chimera of the night. This 'less-is-more' philosophy drives every moment of the film, a science fiction horror story about a deep-space cargo vessel that crashes on a seemingly lifeless, perpetually sun-scorched planet. The disparate crew of space-travelling folk soon discover they're not alone. Not only does the planet have three suns, they've managed to time their shipwreck with that of a solar eclipse occurring every twenty-two years. That's all fine and dandy in the land of Robinson Crusoe but, on this planet, a legion of bloodthirsty nocturnal nasties that put the 'in' in the word 'inhospitable' capitalise on this rare opportunity to wreak hellacious havoc. Lucky for the crew their scary criminal passenger Riddick (Vin Diesel) has spent enough time in enough prisons to have purchased enhanced night-vision (colloquially known as a 'shine job'), enabling this band of outsiders to negotiate the daunting task ahead: Make it back to the ship in one piece. With Riddick leading the way, tension escalates when panic inevitably sets in. The original screenplay by Jim Wheat and Ken Wheat had been sitting on the shelf at Polygram Films for many years before being substantially rewritten by Twohy, who was brought onto the project by producer Tom Engelman on the strength of his work on Terminal Velocity (1994) and The Arrival (1996). Engelman correctly believed Twohy would be a good match for such material, especially given the themes the filmmakers wanted to evoke. It's not just a fear of the dark, but the fear of being subjected to the worst circumstances with the worst kind of people. Twohy is a writer whose work was based on strong structure and strong characters, and part of what he wanted to do was create a movie where the frights were as much what you can't see as what you do see. While the majority of special effects work was realised in England, the film itself was shot in Australia at Warner Brothers Roadshow studios and on location at Coober Peedy in the country's remote southern region. Shooting in Australia gained the production access to a less costly yet thoroughly professional film crew, as well as to the usual dramatic vistas to be found in the Australian desert, a region featuring neither vegetation nor signs of human habitation that was ideal for representing the forbidding unnamed"

I like to go with the flow  watch what I want, ignore what doesn't interest me, and that's it. But if there is one thing I genuinely miss, it's the period where decently budgeted, high concept creature-features could be made and given wide theatrical releases. And they were mainstream! Every once in a while one may slip through the cracks (Alexandre Aja's Crawl and the 47 Meters Down films being recent examples) but for the most part this type of theatrical experience is dead. David Twohy's Pitch Black just recently celebrated its 22nd birthday this year, and I think it's time to celebrate the unlikely franchise-starter for being a damn good sci-fi/horror film that first introduced the cult favorite anti-hero, Riddick. By the time Pitch Black dropped David Twohy had already been in the game for quite some time. His first Hollywood writing credit is for Critters 2: The Main Course and from there he went on to write the cult classic Warlock and has credits for everything ranging from The Fugitive to G.I. Jane to Waterworld. Pitch Black was his third time in the director's chair after helming Timescape and The Arrival. Working from an initial script given over for him to tinker with, Twohy rewrote the film to amp it up into its own beast. There is a distinctive hard-edge, no-nonsense quality to Pitch Black that makes it very appealing. There is a dose of John Carpenter-esque cynicism to the story and characters here that feel right at home alongside films like Escape from New York and The Thing. A transport vessel cruising the backwaters of the space lanes is struck by a rogue asteroid, causing it to crash on a desolate planet scorching under perpetual daylight. The ship was transporting dozens of individuals in cryosleep  everything from holy men on a pilgrimage to one hell of a dangerous convict by the name of Richard B. Riddick  Vin Diesel's breakout, and in my opinion, best role. In their struggle to figure out a way off the planet, the survivors soon find out that they arrived just in time for the planet's nightfall 22 years in the makingand with the darkness comes the monsters. Their only hope of getting off the planet relies on the killer they all fear. Riddick can see in the dark. Can a monster save them from other monsters? High concept premises like this almost always hinge on the characters, and Twohy manages to craft a handful of them that refreshingly break the mold they initially seem to occupy. Our lead, Fry (Radha Mitchell) is hiding a secret from the rest of the survivors  that she almost jettisoned them into space to save her own ass. The cop transporting Riddick, Johns (Cole Hauser) turns out not to be a cop at all, but a mercenary with a drug addiction"
176,JMZ_Doc6_Pitch_black,JMZ_Doc6_Pitch_black,JMZ,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch_black,"In my opinion, Pitch Black (2000) is one of the best science/fiction horror movies out there. Sure, the film isn't going to win any awards for being the best movie ever made, but for pure entertainment value it's hard to beat. It's a little underrated, probably because it stars Vin Diesel. As an actor, it's a little hard to take Vin Diesel seriously, but the role of a feral psychopath brings out the best in his robotic acting skills  the character Riddick is easily Vin Diesel's best role. The rest of Vin Diesel's acting career can be summarized by watching either The Fast and The Furious or one of the horrible xXx movies (and I don't recommend you watch any of those movies). Pitch Black has a simple plot and gets straight to the point  a slow moving transport vessel accidentally passes through the tail of a comet while on autopilot (yes, humanity has mastered deep space travel and cryosleep, but can't develop an autopilot sophisticated enough to detect potentially devastating clouds of high velocity space debris). The hull is breached, the captain gets impaled and the ship begins to crash. Fortunately, the few crew members and passengers who survived were lucky enough to crash onto the surface a planet with a breathable atmosphere (I'm sure my astrophysicist friends can explain the rather astronomical impossibility of that ever happening). In between taking swigs of liquor to stay 'hydrated' on the desert planet and worrying about Riddick, the psychopathic murderer who was also aboard, they stumble upon an abandoned mining camp with a working shuttle craft. But if there is one infallible law of the universe it's this: situations have a way of going from bad to worse. Way fucking worse. Every 22 years the planet (which usually experiences perpetual day due it its three suns) is plunged into a long solar eclipse and the monsters that lurk underground come out and rip apart anything that looks like a tasty snack. Most of the characters are forgettable and there mostly to serve as canon fodder for the hungry aliens. After all, 22 years is a long time to go without a nice red-blooded snack. Claudia Black (who nerds will recognize as Vala Mal Doran from the TV series Stargate SG-1) makes a fairly short appearance as Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery before she gets ripped in half  literally  by winged bat-creatures. The three exceptions to this rule are Riddick (Vin Diesel), Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) and Jack (Rhiana Griffith). Some sort of priest, Abu 'Imam' al-Walid (Keith David), also survives the nightmare planet and makes an appearance in the sequel The Chronicles of Riddick, but he's essentially pointless in both films and just babbles about having faith in God the whole time. God doesn't save anyone in either film; it's always Riddick, the glorified badass who is just enough of an asshole to be lovable, who is the real savior. David Twohy uses fairly interesting directing and cinematography throughout"

Did some executive, considering greenlighting this script, chuckle evilly to himself while calculating precisely how insulting a movie he could produce and still have a decent opening weekend? Or was everyone so gung-ho on making a stylish sci-fi flick that it never occurred to anyone how nonsensical and even amoral the whole thing was? ""Aliens meets The Fugitive meets Con Air,"" is probably how writer David N. Twohy pitched his script. (Also credited as writers are Jim and Ken Wheat, which simply screams of fanboy brothers who wrote and, god knows how, managed to sell a spec script that had to be even more horrendous than what's onscreen, if the more experienced Twohy had to rewrite it.) Twohy  who actually did write The Fugitive, with Jeb Stuart  is also responsible for writing and directing another piece of junk science fiction, The Arrival, which is at least enjoyable on a Mystery Science Theater level. With Pitch Black, though, he descends to a new level of awfulness, in which even the film's highly derivative nature cannot make for campy fun. Pitch Black is not good clean bad fun  it is an insidious offense to any even halfway-demanding movie fan. Pitch Black starts out, if not exactly promising, then at least momentarily gripping. A commercial freight and passenger ship, traveling through deep space, encounters a meteor storm  the small projectiles that rip through the ship are enough to do it serious damage, as well as kill the captain as he sleeps in his cryo chamber. The pilot, Fry (Radha Mitchell), awakened by the ship to deal with the emergency, finds her ship already burning up as it screams through the atmosphere of a planet. In an intense, protracted sequence, the ship breaks up as Fry fights for control of it and manages to guide it to a not entirely disastrous crash landing on the planet's surface. It's the kind of sequence at the end of which you find yourself breathing a sigh of relief along with the characters. But Pitch Black immediately thereafter starts a long slide downhill that doesn't stop until the end credits roll. Only a handful of the ship's passengers have survived, including Johns (Cole Hauser: Good Will Hunting), a law-enforcement type, and his prisoner, Riddick (Vin Diesel: The Iron Giant, Saving Private Ryan), a thoroughly psychotic multiple murderer who, natch, has escaped his industrial-strength restraints in the crash. Besides Fry, there's also a Muslim imam (Keith David: Armageddon, Volcano) and several of his young sons, a teenage boy, and sundry others.

Among the survivors is a violent prisoner, Riddick, on his way to another space prison. Add an odd assortment of other survivors, including the ship's navigator, Fry, and Riddick's captor, the bounty hunter Johns, and you have the makings of a creepy and well-told fable that has much to say about the human condition. The washed-out cinematography makes you feel like you're on the triple sun-blasted planet, and you get thirsty just watching the movie. The rag-tag band soon discovers an abandoned mining colony. It's workers apparently left in a hurryexcept their escape craft is still there, primed to fly but short a few power cells. Mystery and intrigue lurk, as do nasty, bat-like creatures living in the dark caverns nearby. Three suns means no night. No night means no monsters. No monsters mean safety for all. Right? Wrong. Fry puts two and two together to figure out that they are only hours away from a total solar eclipse, which will plunge the entire planet into darkness. And because all the equipment at the mining colony is solar-powered, they will not have enough light to fend off the beasts of the dark. Throw in the uncertainty of how the condemned prisoner will behave and some really scary chase scenes and you have the makings of a grand sci-fi thriller. Positive Elements: Fry, the navigator, has the option on several occasions to abandon her fellow survivors to save her own life, but each time she chooses to put herself in danger to rescue others. The survivors, with one exception, band together in the face of adversity. Spiritual Elements: A key, sympathetically portrayed character is Imam, a Muslim cleric who, with several acolytes, is on the way to a planet called New Mecca when the ship crashes. There are many scenes of Imam praying to Allah and assuring fellow survivors that Allah is still looking out for their welfare. When things look bleakest Imam and Riddick engage in a conversation about how a merciful deity could allow his followers to be put in such a predicament. ""Where is your god?"" Riddick ridicules. ""Why do you pray? It's pointless."" Imam asks Riddick why he does not believe. Riddick replies, ""Oh, I do believe in God, and I absolutely hate him."" Taken out of its Islamic context, a positive lesson can be extracted when Riddick's contempt for and mockery of God are rebuked; when all seems lost, a providential ""accident"" provides the final means of escape. Imam turns to Riddick and says, ""There, Mr. Riddick, is my god."" (An interesting statement considering that Islamic followers do not generally believe in a providential god who intervenes in human affairs.) Sexual & Romantic Content: A female character shows a lot of cleavage as she crawls through a cave opening. A young woman's menstruating becomes a plot point.

A movie like Pitch Black is a difficult one for me to review. In retrospect, Pitch Black seems like pure trash in my mind -- witless, illogical, filled with false scares, and smug in its own sketchy characterization. Amusingly, of the friends with whom I watched the movie, none can remember the exact title. Black Night? Big Black? An interesting sign that the movie had little to distinguish it in memory. However, I was enthused about the film while in the theatre, and perhaps even, though I am embarrassed to say this, gripped. I certainly consider myself to be a cynical moviegoer in general, but sometimes a movie will subvert my inner critic despite my best efforts. During Pitch Black, I sat there slack-jawed, eyes glazed, as the explosions and chases flashed in all their lowbrow glory on the screen. Oh, scary aliens! Please give me some laser beams and big spaceships! I have no critical defence for Pitch Black, and when most science fiction films are considered objectively, they are junk of the worst kind, bottom feeders of the genre, crass commercial exploitations of the so-called tropes of the field with, ironically, little chance of commercial (or critical) success. The connection with science fiction, real science fiction of the purist type present in print, becomes tenuous. I love science fiction, and I love the leading edge found in print, everything from the most beautifully written literary sf to the hardest hard sf. So how is it possible that I keep going to sf films, when the market is a dumping ground year after year for worthless tripe like Battlefield Earth, Hollow Man, Virus, The Faculty, and so forth? Such films fail even as eye candy. My faith in the genre becomes harder to justify. Fortunately, Pitch Black had enough of its own rhythm as spectacle to gain an advantage over the other witless dreck that couldn't even hold my attention the first time around. But Pitch Black is by no means one of the two or three films a year that will be worth watching again. Spectacle wears itself out quickly, and there's always a replacement waiting in line. As for the movie itself, Pitch Black is pretty basic. Some humans crash land on a planet, and they get chomped one by one by aliens with big teeth and sharp claws. Why would aliens want to eat human flesh? As usual, if the movie had an answer for that, it would destroy the entire basis of the plot. Pitch Black also lacks anything in the way of an ecological underpinning. The aliens only come out during darkness, which only happens every 22 years on this particular planet (and thus the title). How do they survive without handy humans to munch on? How did they evolve? And if they had already eaten everything else, how did they survive until the humans arrived?"

But then, neither is consistent characterization, smart dialogue, originality, subtlety or any of the other benchmarks of quality filmmaking. Not that you normally expect such things in a dumb science-fiction/horror hybrid that rips off the ""Alien"" movies. But given that it features a fresh, talented cast and a filmmaker  David Twohy, who made the inconsistent but somewhat original sci-fi thriller ""The Arrival""  who is willing to take some chances, there was at least some hope. Instead, this dopey, poorly paced and surprisingly derivative work is an extreme disappointment. We've seen this plot a million times before, and much better in most cases. Indie star-in-the-making Radha Mitchell has the lead role as Fry, the docking pilot for a star freighter on its way back to our solar system. Unfortunately for her and the ship's passengers, they run smack into the middle of a meteor storm. In the chaos, the ship is damaged and the captain (who's in cry-sleep, natch) is killed. And Fry is lucky to crash-land the ship with even a handful of the passengers intact. Among the notable survivors are bounty hunter Johns (Cole Hauser) and his prisoner, Riddick (Vin Diesel, from ""Saving Private Ryan""), a murderer with enhanced senses and strength. Everyone's pretty much on edge as it is  being stranded light-years away will do that. And when Riddick decides to run off, panic starts to set in. Then, they discover there's an even bigger danger, namely alien carnivores who have already gained a taste for one of survivors. Worse, the planet is due for an eclipse, which will plunge it into darkness and bring the nocturnal killers out en masse. So, despite their differences, the survivors must band together to survive, especially when they discover there's a tiny escape craft left over from an earlier ship's crash-landing. Again, this is nothing new, and Twohy's odd pacing ensures that it's not particularly thrilling. And the characters are either so weak, dumb or unlikable that it's hard to find a reason to care about what happens to them. Of the bunch, Mitchell's doubt-filled character is perhaps the most interesting, though Diesel (who sounds like he's imitating Tony Todd as ""Candyman"") will likely wind up the audience favorite (a troubling notion, considering he's supposed to be a murderer). Even the creature designs  a cobbling together of hammerhead sharks and H.R. Giger's ""Alien"" creations  are unoriginal, though for a film with a limited budget, the effects don't look chintzy. ""Pitch Black"" is rated R for graphic alien attacks, gunfire and violent hand-to-hand combat, profanity, gore (both alien and human), a scene of graphic drug use (narcotics) and use of crude slang terms."

Resuming where ""Spectre"" (2015) left off, Bond has retired until Felix Leiter persuades him to get back in the game and locate a scientist that Spectre kidnapped from an M16 laboratory. He discovers that Spectre is not the biggest game in town and returns home to get answers only to discover that past events did not unfold the way that he thought. As he reassesses his decisions, he must defend an old flame and her family from this bigger threat. I am not into Bond, but Craig so I was going to see ""No Time to Die"" whenever it got released, pandemic or not. With a two-hour forty-three minute run time, I went in a little daunted because as much as I like Craig, a three hour Bond movie does not sound like a good idea especially when ""Quantum of Solace"" (2008) exists. The time flew by, and I am happy to report that it is an entertaining film that feels like an apology for Spectre's short-comings and satisfyingly concludes Craig's reign. While it is no ""Casino Royale"" (2006) or ""Skyfall"" (2012), I would watch it again. ""No Time to Die"" starts like a horror film. I never understood what the franchise saw in Madeleine Swann, Bond's latest love interest from ""Spectre,"" but in this film, the franchise finally fleshed out her character to get us invested in her plotline and retroactively made her careless actions in the prior installment make sense. If she has been fighting this long, you too would go for a walk without protection at night. It makes sense that this film got released in October because Swann as a final girl against the Boogeyman was more interesting than as the latest in a long line of women to fall for Bond's charms. I went from rolling my eyes over the trope that brunettes were bad, and blondes were good until this film. The writers and Lea Seydoux redeemed Swann by distinguishing her independently from her relationship with the protagonist. Even without Bond, I could appreciate her instinct for survival, severely missing though touted in her initial appearance in the prior installment. As a Bond film, ""No Time to Die"" pays homage to the franchise's mythology, and every recurring character has a moment in the spotlight. If you watch Bond movies to learn more about Bond than saving the world, then you may be pleased to know that it ties up a lot of loose ends for the character without sacrificing what we enjoy about the character. Craig's action sequences are memorable whether he is in a shootout in Cuba, pulling a Rambo in a stunning Norwegian forest sequence or fighting the baddie's henchmen on his island lair in the denouement. There is also a lot of unexpected humor amidst the pathos as years of fornicating finally catch up to him, and he faces the consequences"

In No Time to Die, James Bond is dead after 25 installments of the popular series about England's most glamorous secret agentwhich means he will never be backin his present form. This is also Daniel Craig's fifth and final appearance as 007, so enjoy his previously indestructible stoicism for the last time, too. Do this, I hasten to add, only if you are forever dedicated to a fictional action hero who, in your heart of hearts, can do no wrong. In my opinion, he ran out of steam long ago, and now in retirement from Her Majesty's Secret Service, he has no charm, no wit, no sex appeal, no fatal allure for women and he's losing his hair. He dies from stray bullets, deja vu, stale dialogue and mixed reviews. The car chases, the fight sequences (there are two), the helicopter shots, the never-ending guns and exploding warheads have all been done before. This is probably to be expected. You don't go to a James Bond movie to learn anything new. You go to ogle the latest girls, gadgets and exotic locations. The entertainment values are ever apparent, the violence and bloodshed have a certain lift that both defines and defies imagination, and who would have it any other way? You don't always remember what you saw the next day, but you know you had some fun. This time the excitement fades like the popcorn that went with it, and for me, ennui comes on stealthy fingers. No Time to Die may not be the worst James Bond movie ever made, but it's in heavy competition as the dullest one since Octopussy. The film's sole distinction is the fact that it's the James Bond epic that finally manages to make 007 a crashing bore. Directed with more boyish slobber than narrative coherence by Cary Joji Fukunaga from an over-crammed, self-consciously contrived script by no fewer than five writers, No Time to Die hops and stumbles all over the place, but you can still write the plot on the head of a carpet tack. It opens with a flashback to the Italian Alps where a mysterious thug in a white mask plods through the snow to murder a young Madeleine Swann's mother, but young Madeleine narrowly escapes. Cut to the character, all grown up as Lea Seydoux, who may or may not be married to a gooey-eyed, lovesick 007. (The movie is very vague about things that matter.) After some high-speed racing through the mountains in his bulletproof Aston Martin, the two lovers are set upon by agents from the evil crime syndicate SPECTRE in the town square and he dumps Madeleine, thinking she betrayed him. It's the end for Bond and Madeleine, but the movie is just beginning. It helps to know your Ian Fleming history, including Bond's relationship with Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale, as well as the meaning of SPECTRE (you got me there). Cut to Bond trying desperately trying to enjoy his retirement"

This mega-blockbuster is saddled with the extraordinary pressure of salvaging the Daniel Craig era from the ruins of ""Spectre,"" justifying the spy franchise's decision to abandon standalone adventures in favor of a more serialized arc, and resolving its current run in a way that allows the 007 brand to stay relevant in the face of a Marvel-dominated future that has little room for 59-year-old sex pests on her majesty's Secret Service. Phew. And so, in what now seems like an inevitable course-correction, ""No Time to Die"" is a story about the need to leave certain things behind. It's the modern spy movie equivalent of ""The Last Jedi,"" as the universe tells James Bond that he has no choice but to let the past die  to kill it if he has to  and dares Craig to pull the trigger. The actor barely even blinks. Instead, he limps, smirks, and shoots his way through five erratic movies' worth of pent-up emotion in order to make you cry. The result might be the least exciting Bond film of the 21st century, but it's undeniably also the most moving.At the end of the day, ""No Time to Die"" is a second chance at ending Craig's run on a strong note and tying up all of the frayed threads that ""Spectre"" left blowing in the wind, and it makes good on that potential even at the expense of several new shortcomings. Written by Bond custodians Neal Purvis and Robert Wade  with assists from Fukunaga and Phoebe ""Fleabag"" godhead Waller-Bridge  the movie is fittingly also 007's second chance at the happiness that slipped through his fingers when he took Vesper Lynd on the worst trip to Venice since ""Don't Look Now."" And from the moment it starts with the least Bond-like cold open in the franchise's history, it's clear that the spy's 25th official outing will move forward with at least one eye locked on the rearview mirror. By the time Billie Eilish starts belting out the film's downbeat title song more than 25 minutes later, it seems entirely possible that Bond may not be able to move forward at all. It begins in a remote patch of Norwegian nowhere some two decades ago, when the eventual Dr. Madeleine Swann  then only a little girl who's unaware that her father works for Spectre, or that she'll have the good fortune of growing up to become Lea Seydoux  is visited by a killer in a porcelain mask. ""Your father kills people,"" the uninvited visitor says to her. ""Is that who you love? A murderer?"" He might as well be talking to Madeleine (and to us as well) about her future boyfriend.

Fortunately, its utter disinterest in a hard and fast continuity meant that a deliciously hyperbolic film like A View to a Kill can erase a hackneyed Octopussy in under two years. Never before has a James Bond film been both technically well-executed and taken a more serious tack, yet still been an infuriating mess. So, congratulations, I guess, No Time to Die. Borderline impenetrable if you haven't rewatched the first four films in the Daniel Craig-era arc, this 25th canonical Bond picks up where the roundly unloved Spectre finished, with Bond in seeming retirement with Madeleine Swann (Seydoux), and a lot of baggage from earlier films that now seems borderline absurd and needlessly convoluted. The big twist in the last film was that Blofeld (Waltz) was Bond's stepbrother and the cause of all his pain, but the villain this time is Malek as Lyutsifer Safin, a waffling, mumbling pseudophilosophical maniac with the standard grand plans for global domination. Meanwhile Bond ends up more alone than ever: out of MI5, replaced as 007 by a new agent (Lynch), and terribly sad about everything. Because the newer, more emotionally rounded Bond is just sad a lot. Yet No Time to Die doesn't take the opportunity to examine Bond in a more stripped-down setting. Instead, it's the standard mix of globetrotting action, just slower and less engaging than ever before. Subplots go nowhere, new characters are dropped in with little payoff (exactly what purpose a side trip to Cuba with Ana de Armas' giddy young CIA rookie serves defies explanation), and much of the dialogue is simply meaningless  particularly every word out of Safin's mouth, which would just be nonsensical if it wasn't also delivered with all the gravitas and malice of a bus timetable. It's ponderous, tedious, and somehow both buried in continuity and determined to drop it all halfway through the story. It's not just recent Bond lore: there's a hamfisted musical sting that serves as a reference to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, further complicating the already convoluted timeline and inherently conflating two of Bond's dead exes. It's this overstuffed storytelling, mixed with lackluster pacing, that renders No Time to Die a torturous misfire, and an utterly disappointing exit for Craig's Bond. I hate to say it, but this is Bond's Rise of Skywalker. That's the saddest part of this era of 007. Craig had two of the best entries in the entire series, with Casino Royale establishing everything that was going to make him unique, and Skyfall hitting like a battering ram. His Bond was an educated assassin, charming and cold, violently loyal to Queen and Country but untrusting of both  just as Ian Fleming wrote him. Yet the last two films have written him into a melancholic corner, adding a supposed emotional depth that he simply doesn't need. Maybe the arc would have worked better across three films,"
185,KUE_Doc5_No_time_to_die,KUE_Doc5_No_time_to_die,KUE,Action,Positive,No_time_to_die,"No Bond actor has ever exited the role quite the same way Craig does here. The fifth and final entry in the actor's reign as author Ian Fleming's iconic British spy, No Time to Die is an action-heavy swan song that brings this version of 007 full circle. Back in 2006's Casino Royale, his Bond was introduced as a talented newbie with definite skills and a lot left to learn; now he's the grizzled veteran ready to call it a day yet still determined to lay it all on the line for Queen and country. Sean Connery didn't get this type of finale, leaving on his own terms before coming back to Bond for two one-off stories, probably at the inducement of mountains of cash. George Lazenby was in only one Bond film, 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service, but as it's widely considered one of the franchise's best outings, I feel his stint as 007 should be considered in a positive light. Roger Moore started to show his age, and while I enjoy both 1983's Octopussy and 1985's A View to a Kill, it's hard to disagree with those who felt that the actor had overstayed his welcome. Timothy Dalton only got two turns as the character, 1987's The Living Daylights and 1989's License to Kill, and while he was closer in tone to Fleming's literary iteration of Bond, it's clear his cutthroat take wasn't what audiences wanted after over a decade of Moore's suavely comedic incarnation. As for Pierce Brosnan, while 2002's Die Another Day is widely thought to be one of the lesser Bond films, it was still a massive, worldwide box office hit. I think the decision to move on from him had more to do with the success of The Bourne Identity than it did anything else. Brosnan never got the opportunity for one last ride as 007 mainly because producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson determined they could make more money by switching to a more serious and less elegantly exaggerated tone, thus opening the door for Craig. I can't say Broccoli and Wilson were wrong in their assessment. Craig's 007 adventures, while wavering in quality, have proven to be hugely popular with audiences around the globe. The additional time between installments has also allowed the actor to age with Bond and not against him  as happened with Moore  each new film letting him show more wear and tear as the years take their toll on the secret agent. Craig's Bond earned all of his scars, and it's no wonder that at the outset of No Time to Die, he is ready to turn in his license to kill and drive off in his Aston Martin into the Jamaican sunset. But just as Bond thinks he is out, leave it to old friend Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) to pull him back in.

Now retired from the life of an MI6 superspy, Bond says he and his ladylove Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux), whom we met in the last film, Spectre, have ""All the time in the world."" Article content All the time to heal their past wounds, all the time to write a different ending for themselves. Of course, for both the suave agent and the legions of fans who have embraced Craig's 007, that mantra is nothing more than wishful thinking. Maybe it would have been a better line for the ending of 2015's Spectre, as Bond and Swann drove off into the sunset and Craig mused in the press that he'd rather ""slash his wrists"" than return as the character. Then we all could have believed in fanciful happy endings. As it turns out, that idyllic life is just a mirage. After an opening that ties the film's main villain Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek) to Swann, the action cuts to the mountain roads of Italy as Bond and Madeleine race towards a happily-ever-after. But the tranquillity is short-lived as SPECTRE agents hunt them down. How did they find them so easily? Bond immediately thinks he's been betrayed, and after an extended chase scene, he unceremoniously chucks Madeleine on a train. No time for goodbyes. The action picks up five years later, when an old pal from earlier films, CIA handler Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), interrupts Bond's single life in Jamaica to ask him for help in tracking down a missing scientist (David Dencik) behind a dangerous nanotech, nicknamed Heracles. As the story (by director Cary Fukunaga, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge) continues in Cuba, Bond teams up with CIA newbie Paloma (the delightful Ana de Armas) and crosses paths with his 00 replacement (Lashana Lynch). Turns out, the mission isn't a simple snatch-and-grab. Bond's been double-crossed again and before he knows it, he's back in front of his old nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), now locked up in Belmarsh Prison. And oh look, there's Madeleine. It turns out she's the only one Blofeld will talk to. The mysterious Heracles project, which his old boss M (Ralph Fiennes) had a hand in creating, then sends Bond and Madeleine down a path where both their lives will be irrevocably changed by Safin. To say more, would venture into spoiler territory. But Fukunaga  the first American-born filmmaker to helm a Bond picture  manages to tie many plot points together, bringing Craig's run to a wholly satisfying end. Unlike Pierce Brosnan's films, these Bond stories require investment on the part of viewers. You need to know what happened in the entries before this one for the full import of the denouement to hit home. Craig's Bond is a hero that has been bruised by years of loss and betrayal, and we see the ramifications of that here."

Some people rushed to spread this information online after the film's world premiere screenings in London last week, the Film Twitter equivalent of Homer exiting The Empire Strikes Back on opening night. The statute of limitations on surprises in the social media era is perilously short, but it should still be possible to review No Time to Die without coming out and saying the thing that its marketing, promotion, and coyly morbid title have already implied. For nearly 60 years, the franchise has consolidated its own form of immortality by doubling down, baccarat-style, on the idea that its star attraction Will Returnnever mind whether in the same exact corporeal form. Like any long-standing, ceremonial role of significant cultural importancethe queen of England, commissioner of the National Basketball Association, Dr. WhoJames Bond is at once bigger than the person who inhabits him and malleable enough to fit each host vessel's specifications. He's a designer tuxedo being taken in for alterations, or a vintage Aston Martin receiving periodic tune-ups. In 1983, 12 years after graciously abdicating the part that made him a megastar, Sean Connery reneged on his decision to opt out. Looking considerably older and a bit embarrassed, he top-lined the nonSaltzman-and-Broccoli Thunderball knockoff Never Say Never Again, a film whose title goofed on the actor's noble, broken promise to himself. (The idea for the joke was credited to Connery's wife, an all-time case of spousal trolling.) This one exception aside, there isn't a single Bond entry, good, bad, or Moonraker, that goes out of its way to explicitly acknowledge the identity of its leading man. Nor have there been any teary-eyed curtain calls. At the end of A View to a Kill, instead of riding off into the sunset, Roger Moore hooked up with Tanya Roberts in a shower. In this sense, the valedictory vibe of No Time to Die makes it an outlier. Every element, from the plot to the visual style to the thickly funereal atmosphere, has been calibrated to emphasize its status as a send-off for Craig, whose constant, Connery-like carping about his boredom with the part aligns with his version of the character. There's always been a borderline-misanthropic intensity to James Bond, a cool sense of detachment derived from Ian Fleming's literary description of the character's cold blue eyes and ""cruel"" mouth. Craig took these qualities and ran with them, becoming the first Bond who never seemed to be having any fun. Gloom and doom have been the common denominators of the 21st-century Bonds, with mixed and fascinating results. Like Skyfall and Spectre, No Time to Die is primarily about the bonds and scars etched between parents and children. Bookended by scenes in which little girls are terrorized by psychopaths and featuring multiple sequences in which beloved, long-running characters are forced to contemplate their own mortality, it's a parched, solemn"

The 25th installment in the venerable 007 series is the first to be directed by an American, Cary Joji Fukunaga, who handles the action with assurance and the more intimate interludes with sensitivity, never forgetting that there's a wounded, vulnerable human being beneath the licensed-to-kill MI6 agent. The uneven movie's big issue, however, is that the path to Craig's momentous departure is drowning in plot; it's so convoluted and protracted you might find yourself zoning out through much of the villainy. Even so, it's doubtful that this will be a deal-breaker for many Bond completists  especially given that the worldwide appetite for the high-speed chases, thundering explosions, gunfire, fight scenes and breathtaking stunt work that are abundant staples of every 007 thriller has been heightened by repeat delays from its original April 2020 release date. Even if the two-and-three-quarter hour running time is occasionally a slog, it ultimately delivers. Viewed within the context of Craig's tenure, No Time to Die certainly allows the actor to dig deeper on the rewarding character work he's been doing since his 21st century reinvention of the role. Previous incarnations of Ian Fleming's British secret agent have been defined by the sexy swagger, the arched eyebrow and the cool, calm composure even in the hairiest of situations, that glib characterization growing particularly tired in the Roger Moore years. Craig has steadily minimized those more caricatured aspects as he explored the interiority of a man haunted by loss  notably of Eva Green's Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale and Judi Dench's M in Skyfall  and at war with his own trust issues. He's also fighting against time, as the new film's title implies. Another crushing loss awaits him in No Time to Die, well before his final reckoning. But what's notable here is that this is arguably the most tender portrait of James Bond we've ever seen; the emotional stakes are raised by a love that's far more than the usual passing flirtation. Just as Vesper stirred something in James' world-weary heart and then shattered it in betrayal, the romance with Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) that began in Spectre evolves here into a potential escape from a life in which he's constantly looking over his shoulder. The revelation of a secret more than halfway through the movie only intensifies his soulful surrender to the possibility of a personal fulfillment that Bond perhaps never believed was within his grasp. But in order to fire on all cylinders, James Bond needs a worthy adversary, a seductive, viciously witty villain on the level of, say, Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre in Casino Royale, or Javier Bardem's Silva in"

That might have been George Lazenby's quip in the opening sequence of On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), but it's also become the rallying cry for the Daniel Craig era of Bond pictures, which began with him as an inexperienced, impulsive agent just earning his license to kill in Casino Royale (2006) and ends now with him as a weathered, embittered, desperately-in-love man in No Time to Die. In retrospect, it feels as if Lazenby's cute, fourth-wall-breaking acknowledgment (reportedly ad-libbed on set by the star himself) that his post-Connery turn might be a different Bond perhaps liberated the series a little: Once that line landed, nobody had to worry about keeping any kind of consistency between Bond actors, or even individual movies. Of course, within the actual Craig cycle, the inter-film callbacks and echoes and through lines have been nonstop  and not always for the best. At the start of No Time to Die, Bond is still grieving Vesper Lynd, his lover and partner from Casino Royale, while also committing to a life with Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux), the assassin's daughter and psychiatrist he romanced (rather unconvincingly) in Spectre (2015). This new one even opens with an episode from Madeleine's childhood that she'd related in that previous entry, only now it's been revised to become our introduction to Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), a psycho who went off the deep end after his whole family was killed by Madeleine's father, Mr. White. White was, as you may or may not recall from the previous film, an assassin working for SPECTRE, the international criminal organization led by Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), the devious mastermind whom Bond made sure to lock up at the end of that picture. Staying true to our modern age of action movies-as-elaborate-soap operas, it also turned out that Blofeld  organ music, please  is Bond's long-lost adopted brother. No, this definitely never happened to the other fellas. Indeed, the central project of the Daniel Craig era could easily be seen as an experiment to see how un-Bond-like one could make these films while still being able to call them Bond films. The experiment reaches its apotheosis in No Time to Die, which opens with Bond in love, then moves on to Bond betrayed, then Bond retired, then Bond working for the CIA, before bringing Bond back into the fold of MI6, where it turns out he's actually been replaced by a new 007, Nomi, played by Lashana Lynch. (If you think those are spoilers, note that I've said nothing of Bond's [redacted], his discovery of [redacted], or the dramatic [redacted]s of [redacted], [redacted], and [redacted].) There are opportunities here, many of them missed: The two 007s have a playful rivalry at first, and one wishes the script featured more of their repartee.

So it's only fitting that this, the 25th official episode in the 007 series, should bend a few rules and spring several surprises, including an outrageous narrative cheat. Pulling out all the stops with wild  if not exactly gleeful  abandon, director Cary Joji Fukunaga and his co-writers find various elegant solutions to wrapping up the Daniel Craig cycle of Bond movies as a self-contained, interconnected series. So there's plenty to gawk at, and to argue over, in this episode - yet No Time To Die is oddly lacking in pleasure or real wit. It's certainly a film that breaks many of the canonical rules of the series, though not entirely to dazzling effect That shouldn't harm the film's chances for new distributor Universal when, in the wake of delay after delay, No Time To Die is finally released after its bells-and-whistles world premiere at the Royal Albert Hall. The film's journey to the big screen has been as unpredictable as any of 007's adventures, following an abortive start with Danny Boyle at the helm, and a series of delays because of Covid-19  pushing the eventual release back several times since the original planned date of April 2020. All this has made No Time To Die  directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, shifting into much higher gear after the varied likes of Sin Nombre, Beasts Of No Nation and TV's True Detective  even more of a symbolic test of theatrical releasing's return to health than Tenet or any recent Marvel release. Add to that assorted headline-worthy news, like the addition of Phoebe Waller-Bridge to the writing team, black actress Lashana Lynch as an MI6 agent working under the hallowed 007 denomination, and Fukunaga's recent admission that the Connery-era Bond was in certain films effectively a rapist  all of this makes No Time To Die a very hot potato indeed. It's certainly a film that breaks many of the canonical rules of the series, though not entirely to dazzling effect. The taboo-busting starts at the beginning, with the time-honoured prelude involving not Bond, but presented as another character's flashback  a return to the childhood of Bond's squeeze from Spectre, Dr Madeleine Swann, as a child witnessing a sinister masked man invading her family's snowbound Norwegian house in revenge against her assassin father. Cut to years later, and an adult Swann (a somewhat glum Lea Seydoux) is enjoying an Italian break with the now-retired Bond (Daniel Craig) in Italy. Sustaining a link with the events of Casino Royale, he's still moping over deceased love Vesper, and visits her tomb (yes, this is a Bond who seeks closure), only to find some of his enemies have gotten there first, occasioning a slam-bam car and motorbike chase that, a little prematurely, provides the biggest razzle dazzle in the film.

So many movies are well intended but poorly made that when something like ""Taken"" comes along, it's a relief, almost a joy. There's nothing lofty in the intentions of ""Taken."" The aspiration here was to make a simple, straight-ahead action thriller. Period. But if you think that's easy, think of all the lousy action thrillers that come out in the course of a year. The level of skill that went into ""Taken"" is masterly. This is a picture that will appeal mainly to people who love movies, and I use the word ""love"" advisedly. Viewers who love movies for their true soul - for their obviousness, for their manipulations, for their corniness, for their blend of high and low emotion - will take great pleasure in ""Taken."" Others, who like movies conditionally, like a wayward lover they hope to reform, may end up hating ""Taken"" - or at least thinking of it as something stupid, ridiculous, far-fetched and worthless. Which reminds me of a story: When I was 6, all the kids I knew used to watch the TV show ""Batman."" We took it very, very seriously. Then, at around 7, we realized it was ridiculous. Then, when we were around 9, we realized it was intended to be ridiculous, and we liked it again. At 7, we thought we were quite sophisticated, but, it turned out, there were higher levels of appreciation. ""Taken"" requires that higher level of appreciation. In terms of pace and economy, it's beautiful to behold. Director Pierre Morel, working from a script by Robert Mark Kamen (""The Fifth Element"") and Luc Besson, knows when to slow down and lavish time on characters to establish the emotions and motivations that are going to give the action its urgent undercurrent. Liam Neeson plays Brian, a nice, easygoing fellow whose main mission in life, as the film starts, is to rekindle a relationship with his teenage daughter. Apparently, he was a workaholic who neglected his family and wrecked his marriage, but he's determined to keep that one flickering connection alive and thriving. Oh, yes, and it turns out that he's a former CIA agent. Of course he is. What did you think, that this movie was going to be some boring thing about a family? Wake up and smell the explosions! So what happens next? How do the screenwriters connect the dedicated-father angle with the former CIA-agent angle? Three guesses. ... What, you only needed one guess? That's right, the daughter is taken and borne away by an international cabal of criminals. Anyone could devise this premise. The real measure of ""Taken"" is not in what happens but in how it happens. Observe, for example, the intelligent construction of the abduction scene.

And he's paid a price for his fists. Bryan once devoted so much concentration and energy to his job as a ""preventer"" (""I prevented bad things from happening"") that his wife (a wasted Famke Janssen, who usually plays these roles herself) left him for a rich California businessman and took their daughter with them.

He does, of course, but not before he slam-dunks his way through the City of Light, turning it into darkness. Equipped with Uzis, knives, swords and even an electric chair, Bryan works without official supervision or an expense account, yet never seems to run out of steam or cash. And there is no limit to his ability to tap international phone lines, spark the ignition in foreign cars without keys and find new ways to torture and kill his victims. In one scene, when he fails to get the right answer from a man strapped to a chair in the middle of a brutal interrogation, he electrocutes him, filling the room with smoke, fire and the smell of burning flesh. Each new victim (including some of France's leading power players) only piques the simmering rage of a vengeful parent, and we all know that a dangerous secret agent with a mission makes for panic in the streets. Turning the tables on master fiends, police officials and their families, ransacking Paris for clues, Bryan ends up in a shootout on"

Neeson, who now resembles an aging Labrador retriever, all angles and mournful eyes and jumpy eagerness, plays a former CIA spook whose clandestine career bled into his home and made blood sausage of his family. His wife has divorced him, taken their 17-year-old daughter and remarried. She now lives a life of entitlement behind the stone walls of a Los Angeles mansion, the estate of her new industrialist husband. Neeson's character, Bryan Mills, is so protective of his daughter that he moves to L.A. to be within reach of her. He is paranoid about the potential dangers, and so humorless he could be played for parody -- thankfully, though, St. Guilty Pleasure has shined upon us, and this thing is serious. It also feels, already, a couple of weeks into the Obama administration, like a relic of a former political atmosphere -- despite being made by French producer Luc Besson and some of the European folks behind that hurtling go-go-go ""Transporter"" series. The bad guys are French, Eastern European and generic Middle Eastern stereotypes. And although Daddy means well, he tears apart society to prove it. But first: Bryan's daughter (Maggie Grace) asks to fly to Europe with her best friend, and Bryan says this is a bad idea because there are evildoers in the world, but his daughter says she just wants to follow U2 across the Continent (""all the kids do it,"" Bryan's wife says), so Bryan agrees begrudgingly, and within minutes -- nay, seconds -- of stepping into Charles de Gaulle International, his daughter and friend are kidnapped by sex traffickers. Told ya. The good news is they've been spared sitting through 17 renditions of ""Where the Streets Have No Name."" The bad news is they're about to be sold into slavery. Bryan has 96 hours to find her. Why 96? Because that's the number his fellow former-CIA friends pull out of their, ahem, back pockets. After the first 20 minutes, however -- during which I found myself pining for the days of Generic Harrison Ford Action Vehicles and that signature scowl (""Give me back my daughter!"" ""Get off my plane!"") -- it wasn't hard settling into Oskar Schindler, Avenging Angel. Neeson is too smart an actor to step into the path of a picture with this much forward momentum. The movie overheats cleanly around him, moving from nuts to stupid without pausing for sentiment or logic or even the sort of basic explanation most filmmakers would accept as fundamental. Instead, see this and you will want to slam someone's head against a table, which is a nice feeling, assuming you don't act on it. ""You can't run around tearing down Paris,"" friend Jean-Claude tells Bryan. ""I would tear down the Eiffel Tower, Jean-Claude!"" he shouts, then proceeds to karate chop his way through mimes, baguette peddlers"
194,LCK_DOC4_Taken,LCK_DOC4_Taken,LCK,Action,Negative,Taken,"NEXT out of the January dreg-u-lator: A Liam Neeson thriller so lacking in ambition they should have called it ""Paycheck."" ""Taken,"" one of those Frenchy efforts to do an American-style chase-'em-down and shoot-'em-up, comes from formerly respectable producer Luc Besson and director Pierre Morel, whose homegrown, low-budget action thriller ""District B13"" was a lively little collection of stunts. In trying to broaden their scale to interest a big American audience, Besson and Morel are as convincing as Marcel Marceau doing John Wayne. Neeson plays a retired ex-spook trying to mend fences with the teen daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), he had with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen), who is still bitter about being neglected during his career as an international undercover agent. We learn that Neeson's Bryan left his teammates in the middle of a mission in Beirut so he could fly 9,000 miles to attend one of his daughter's birthday parties. So which is it: Was he distant or dedicated? And why do his ex-mates think he's such a great guy if he disappears every time he wants to go wrap a present? Bryan is a growly killin' machine trying to find his daughter after she is kidnapped on a trip to Paris. To find his way, he uses a road map of cliches: moldy dialogue (""I will find you. And I will kill you""), improbable escapes from teams of incompetent henchmen (just shoot him in the head, guys  don't handcuff him to a loose overhead pipe) and one of those only-in-the-movies sofas that is bulletproof and fluffy at the same time. When the machine guns roar, just get behind one of these babies and watch the air fill with soft, pretty flurries of stuffing. Available at Crate & Gunbarrel. The movie has two tasks: One is to track Neeson's every step as he pieces together the mystery of where his daughter is. The other is to stage cool chases and gunfights. Both the action and the mystery scenes, though, are made up of such choppy, sloppy, laugh-till-you-drop-y elements that I couldn't figure out whether the movie was rushing through the fights to get back to the mystery or vice versa. An example of how the mystery plays out: Bryan plays a tape of a snippet of conversation between his daughter's attackers to one of his fellow spies. The spy tells him that the men are speaking Albanian, identifies what town they're from, guesses what their game is (trafficking in women to turn into prostitutes) and even explains who their crime boss is. I wish I had a Basil Exposition of my own to decode Neeson's accent. The Irish actor chews over his words as though speaking through a mouthful of mashed potatoes. After half an hour, it dawned on me that he might be trying to sound American, although I couldn't be sure. ""You need my permission to leave the coontry?"" he asks. The fights and chases are so scrambled that it's hard to figure out basics such as"
195,LCK_DOC5_Taken,LCK_DOC5_Taken,LCK,Action,Positive,Taken,"Thank heavens Liam Neeson is getting old. At 56, he's ""taken"" a bit of a career turn playing a lethal black ops action hero, a type of role he's apparently avoided throughout his illustrious career. But perhaps the meatier roles are getting thin these days, so who better to star in ""Taken"" than an Irish actor with the breadth and depth of the former Oskar Shindler, Jean Valjean, and Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn for crying out loud? (Not to mention the upcoming Abraham Lincoln in a pic by Steven Spielberg). Neeson is a major reason ""Taken,"" a riveting, revenge thriller gets praiseworthy marks. The body count is as high as the amount of coincidences that seem to work out in retired CIA agent Bryan Mills' (Neeson) favor. If you are willing to give the movie a little latitude, ""Taken"" is smart and fast enough to please most everyone. Mills tries to make up for lost time with his now estranged 17-year-old daughter (Fresh faced Maggie Grace) and struggles for her attention with his unforgiving ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and her new mega-rich hubby (Xander Berkeley). He kills time eating Chinese take-out with his fellow retired agents, and helping with occasional security jobs like body guarding celebrity pop singers. His worst fears about his daughters' trip to Paris with a girl friend are confirmed when they get kidnapped and are forced into a sordid slavery/prostitution ring headed up by a gang of Albanian thugs. But Mills has skills, a ""particular set of skills..."" that allow him to make good on his promise to his daughters' captors: ""I will look for you, I will find you. And I will kill you."" It's not hard to believe everything Neeson says on screen and so we have a Bourne-like manhunt story grounded in the gravitas of a tall, foreboding Oscar nominee who wears a friendly fury on his face like few actors. There's a point in these types of action films where plausibility flys out the glass- plated windows so pervasive in this genre, but if the film at least makes attempts to show a reasonable amount of reality then some type of standard has been met. Could a trained killing machine recognize the source of a two-word statement by a foreign stranger recorded on a cell phone? Yes, if we see him studying it meticulously. Would he shoot, without killing mind you, an innocent to prove a point? Who knows? But it makes for a great action picture moment. Speaking of killing, if you're going to be a killjoy and dwell on this film's implausibilities, stay home and let the rest of us enjoy the rush."
196,LCK_DOC6_Taken,LCK_DOC6_Taken,LCK,Action,Positive,Taken,"Without ever taking his shirt off, Liam Neeson makes a surprisingly convincing one-man mean machine in ""Taken,"" in which an ex-CIA agent rids Paris of most of its Albanian population while rescuing his darlin' teen daughter from nasty white-slave traders. Very much in the style of other non-redemptive Euro shoot-'em-ups from Luc Besson's EuropaCorp stable (""The Transporter,"" etc.), dumb, pedal-to-the-metal actioner will sit well with target auds in fast playoff before robust ancillary. Late February release in Gaul has already notched up a warm $4 million in its first two frames; Stateside release via Fox is skedded for September. Onetime Langley grunt Bryan Mills (Neeson) has moved to Los Angeles to be near his spoiled 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), now embedded in a world of luxury since his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) married rich businessman Stuart (Xander Berkeley). When some ex-CIA pals offer him a night's work bodyguarding a singer (Holly Valance), it's clear Bryan has lost none of his Jason Bourne-like skills when he saves the diva from an attempted slaying. Under pressure from Lenore, Bryan reluctantly agrees to let Kim go on a Euro trip with schoolfriend Amanda (Katie Cassidy). But when both girls are kidnapped by evil Albanians within minutes of their arrival, Bryan hops one of Stuart's private jets to Paris to find her. He reckons he has 96 hours before Kim ends up a drug-addicted lump of white meat. Besson alum Pierre Morel, who was d.p. on ""The Transporter"" and previously helmed 2004's futuristic actioner ""District B13,"" wisely doesn't give the viewer any time to ponder the string of unlikely coincidences in the script by Besson and regular scribe Robert Mark Kamen. From the actual kidnapping  breathlessly staged with Kim actually on the phone with dad  to Bryan arriving in Paris and immediately causing a pileup outside the airport, pic has the forward, devil-may-care momentum of a Bond movie on steroids. With grudging help from former French intelligence op Jean-Claude (Olivier Rabourdin) and an Albanian translator (Goran Kostic), Bryan discovers and then trashes the baddies' ramshackle brothel prior to tracking down kidnapper Marko (Arben Bajraktaraj) and his gang. He then learns Kim has been sold in a high-class auction arranged by a certain Patrice St. Clair (Gerard Watkins) for  natch!  Arab clients. Interventionist politics of the movie, which plays like ""Rambo in Paris,"" hardly bear thinking about, but Neeson growls his way through the functional dialogue as an unstoppable killing machine in impressive, cold-eyed style. For a thesp now in his mid-50s, he handles the niftily edited, bone-crunching action way better than his scenes as a sappy, devoted father. Other thesps simply register as evil gun-fodder or script cutouts (including a wasted Janssen), with only Rabourdin suggesting anything like a real character. Widescreen package is technically slick at all levels, and ditto the action choreography, in a cartoonish way."
197,LCK_DOC7_Taken,LCK_DOC7_Taken,LCK,Action,Positive,Taken,"If CIA agents in general were as skilled as Bryan Mills in particular, Osama bin Laden would have been an American prisoner since late September 2001. ""Taken"" shows Mills as a one-man rescue squad, a master of every skill, a laser-eyed, sharpshooting, pursuit-driving, pocket-picking, impersonating, knife-fighting, torturing, karate-fighting killing machine who can cleverly turn over a petrol tank with one pass in his car and strategically ignite it with another. We meet Mills (Liam Neeson) in ""sort of retirement"" in Los Angeles, grilling steaks with old CIA buddies and yearning to spend more time with his 17-year-old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). Kim now lives with her mom, Mills' ex-wife (Famke Janssen), and her effortlessly mega-rich husband (Xander Berkeley), whose idea of a birthday present is giving Kim not a pony, but what looks like a thoroughbred. Mills has seen action in Afghanistan and apparently everywhere else, and knows it's a dangerous world for a naive teenage girl. He is against Kim spending the summer in Paris with her girlfriend, even though ""cousins"" will apparently chaperone. He's right. Kim and her pal succeed in getting themselves kidnapped the afternoon of the same day they get off the plane, although Kim has time for one terrified phone call to Dad before she's taken away. Now listen to this. Using CIA contacts at Langley, Mills is able to use his garbled tape of their conversation to determine the name of his girl's kidnapper (Marko), that he is Albanian, that his ring kidnaps young tourists, drugs them and runs them as prostitutes; the virgins are auctioned off to Arab sheiks and so on. Headquarters also tells Mills he has 96 hours to rescue his daughter before she meets a fate worse than death, followed by death. With this kind of intelligence, the CIA could be using bin Laden's Visa card in every ATM in Virginia. It's the set-up for a completely unbelievable action picture where Mills is given the opportunity to use one element of CIA spycraft after another, read his enemies' minds, eavesdrop on their telephones, spy on their meetings and, when necessary, defeat roomfuls of them in armed combat. At one point, a former colleague in the Paris police says he has left seven bodies behind. He's just getting warmed up. How this man and his daughter could hope to leave France on a commercial flight doesn't speak highly of the French police  and the new ""Pink Panther"" doesn't open for a week. Oh, why does he have only 96 hours? To provide the movie with a handy deadline, that's why. It's always a puzzle to review a movie like this. On the one hand, it's preposterous. But who expects a ""Bourne""-type city-wrecking operative to be plausible? On the other hand, it's very well-made. Liam Neeson brings the character a hard-edged, mercilessly focused anger, and director Pierre Morel hurtles through action sequences at a breathless velocity. If Kim is an empty-headed twit, well, she's offscreen most of the time, and the"
198,LCK_DOC8_Taken,LCK_DOC8_Taken,LCK,Action,Positive,Taken,"I had to adjust my mind a bit before watching ""Taken,"" an action/thriller starring Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills, a retired spy turned domestic bodyguard who gets called back into action when his 17-year-old daughter (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped by Albanian sex traffickers while vacationing in Paris. My adjustment had nothing to do with the action, which is your fairly straightforward action flick co-written and produced by Luc Besson. Try to follow me. ""Taken"" co-stars Famke Janssen as Bryan's ex-wife. Janssen starred in last year's festival darling ""Turn the River,"" screened during the Indianapolis International Film Festival alongside this critic's preferred Minnie Driver vehicle, ""Take."" So, I'm sitting in the theatre watching ""Taken"" thinking ""Where's Minnie Driver?"" Fortunately, there's nothing in ""Taken"" that is anywhere near as confusing. In fact, if you really give a hoot about logical storylines, character development or plot then ""Taken"" is most likely not for you. ""Taken"" is an action film. Nothing more. Nothing less. As an action film, ""Taken"" kicks ass. As Bryan Mills, Liam Neeson kicks lots of ass in a wide variety of ways. Neeson has been in action films before, but there's something a bit tired about ""Taken."" It's sort of along the lines of Harrison Ford's fourth turn as Indiana Jones. Was that fourth Indiana Jones flick horrible? No, not really. It was just wholly unnecessary. ""Taken,"" as action-packed as it is, just feels like an unnecessary cinematic diversion for Neeson. In other words, ""Taken"" is a paycheck film. Fans of pure, unadulterated action and/or Besson flicks are likely to find much more to like about ""Taken"" than film critics. By nature, we're a more demanding audience less likely to excuse the storyline, character and plot issues. Can we get lost in mindless action? Sure. Are we going to write a rave review about it? Probably not, unless it's one of the usual quote whores (You know who you are!). To the credit of director Pierre Morel, ""Taken"" moves along swiftly and is seldom boring. Morel keeps the action going at a top notch rate, much as he did with the far more enjoyable ""District B13."" At 93 minutes, ""Taken"" is a breezy, mindless, violent and thrilling ride that never makes sense but certainly invades the senses. Neeson seems well aware that ""Taken"" doesn't require anything resembling acting, and while he occasionally seems to be coasting a bit much it's not nearly as lazy a performance as Michael Caine tends to do in similar situations. Likewise, Grace and Janssen aren't really called upon to do much but certainly don't do anything to distract from the goings on. On a weekend when Renee Zellweger tries to distract the romantic audiences away from Superbowl Sunday, it's the hardcore action fans who are likely to be ""Taken."""
199,LCK_DOC9_Taken,LCK_DOC9_Taken,LCK,Action,Negative,Taken,"The conundrum posed by ""Taken"" is as old as cinema itself. Do stars degrade themselves when they take a role in trash, or does their very presence redeem the folly, turning up something that glitters amid the dross? A trenchcoated Robert Mitchum, for instance, sauntered through the villainous Europe of ""Foreign Intrigue"" (1956), but his saunter is pretty much all that remains; the rest of the movie was forgettable to start with. Now we have another looming hulk, Liam Neeson, laying similar waste to a posse of un-American scoundrels. Like Mitchum, Neeson has shoulders so wide that you have to inspect the back of his jacket to make sure that he didn't leave the coat hanger in. Like Mitchum, too, he appears to move slowly, at his noble leisure, yet to act with daunting swiftness when the occasion demands. He is more alert than Mitchum, whose brand of cool verged on the narcoleptic, but both men lord it over their surroundingsnot with a wink but with a bang. Why spoof the world when you can wreck it with a straight face? In ""Taken,"" Neeson plays a former C.I.A. hand named Bryan Mills, who is divorced from his wife (Famke Janssen) and living in Los Angeles to be near his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). If there's one thing we've learned from ""California Dreamin',"" it's that seventeen-year-old daughters get into scrapes. And if there's one thing we've learned from ""24"" it's that anybody named Kim, with a father schooled in dirty work by the U.S. government, will have a large echo chamber where her brain is meant to be. Kim and a friend leave for a vacation in Europe, where, ignoring the advice of her father, they are abducted with such consummate speed that it might have been simpler if he had FedExed them directly to the kidnappers. Pausing only to borrow a private jet from his ex's slimy husband, Mills flies to Paris, where he proceeds to work his way, without mercy, through a personal alphabet of undesirable aliens. This being a brisk affair, of little more than ninety minutes, he gets only as far as Albanians and Arabs, but, if I were an innocent Bermudan, let alone a Belgian, I would be starting to get nervous about a sequel. The producer and co-writer is Luc Besson, and the director is Pierre Morel, who made the superior ""District B13."" That had Paris under its fingernails, whereas ""Taken"" darts from one location to the next without probing the city that lies between the hot spots, although Neeson would argue that, once you learn to drive like a Parisian, the opportunities for sightseeing tend to flash past. His performance is the most perturbing thing in the film, even more so than its electrical-torture sequence or its revelations about sex-trafficking; Mills, like some older, vaster brother of Daniel Craig's James Bond, seems driven toor, increasingly, driven byacts of vengeance that are only obliquely related to the wrong that is being avenged.

We see a guy elude his pursuer by jumping from a highway onto the street below and, as he stands up unhurt, get whacked by a truck that neither he nor the audience saw coming. Kudos to the stunt team for what could be the finest-ever twist on a standard action-movie bit of business. The second best part of Taken is a phone message the movie's hero, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), leaves for the man who has just kidnapped his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). ""I don't know who you are,"" Bryan says, his voice icy with a strong man's resolve. ""I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."" Ba-dump. Befitting a B-minus exploitation film, that steely speech is in the 30-sec. TV spot that sold Taken as a smart thriller and that will probably land the movie at No. 1 for the weekend. But if a movie's high points are a quick smack of carnage and a steely speech that everyone's already seen in the trailer, you know it must be January. That's the time of year when no film is bad enough to go direct to DVD, and studios dump their slag on a public eager to flee from all those high-minded Oscar contenders and see a real movie. Taken could have been a real movie, and a good one. It spices its torture-porn premise  a man trying to save his daughter from being peddled as the tender meat in a white-slave ring  with Neeson's stolid, solid presence. But the film promises so much more than it delivers that by the end, I felt like registering a complaint with the Obama Administration's consumer-protection squad. Silly me: I'd been looking forward to Taken, in part because it was directed by Pierre Morel, whose previous film was District 13, a fast-'n'-brutal, half-classic crime movie highlighting the art of parkour. That's the working-class-thug form of gymnastics that sends athletic young men hurtling over roofs, through transoms and down staircases, all without the aid of a digital art brush. Morel, a cinematographer directing his first feature, kept things moving and snarling with a scuzzy brio and made expert use of the artless screen presence of the leading men (one a stunt man, the other a co-creator of parkour). The picture barely broke $1 million at the North American box office, but you can bet the makers of the Bourne and Bond films were watching. Both Morel"

Save for a pair of atrocious Sex and the City romps, if you take the modern and the classic span of raunchy R-rated comedies, from 2009's The Hangover to 1982's Porky's and every Will Ferrell and Sean William Scott thing in between, it's the men who get to drink, party, get crazy, drool over the opposite sex, make bad choices, and bring their friends along for the fun. Are men the only ones capable of all that scandalous fun? Any reasonable college student, reformed (or are they?) college graduate, or Beyonce ""single lady"" knows that's not true. Are women not capable of having a filthy mind and the initiative to pull off their own sophomoric behavior? Hell no! Have you ever crossed paths with a bachelorette party out on the town? My fellow Chicagoans, just spend a Saturday night at Howl at the Moon on Hubbard or any bar on Division Street and you will be well educated. Sure, us men might get drunk and go to a strip club, but some lady gangs can top that. There's a level of detail, planning, and commitment (just as in life) that far exceeds that of men. Just look for the penis-shaped props, extra puffy tulle, and listen for ""Girls Gone Wild""-decibel-level yelling. The new comedy Bridesmaids lets the girls get a shot at debauchery and toilet humor. The results are hilarious, with a surprising touch of heart in a lot of places. Every lady in America who has ever been a bride, a bridesmaid, or a maid of honor should see this movie. You will either laugh at the moments that remind you of your own wedding party or laugh thankfully that none of these characters were anyone of you or someone your know.

She's single, but eeks out fake passion from being the booty call of a sportscar-driving douchebag (Mad Men's Jon Hamm, perfectly cast). Her car is on it's last leg and she goes home to two terrible British import roommates in Milwaukee. She's a failed entrepreneur baker who, after closing her start-up bake shop to the tough economic times, is very close to the pride-swallowing move of living back with her equally odd mother (the late two-time Academy Award nominee Jill Clayburgh, in her final role). Her one constant pillar of support has always been her childhood friend, Lillian (former and fellow SNL vet Maya Rudolph). Once inseparable childhood friends, Lillian's move to Chicago and Annie's tough times have put a little more distance than usual between them, but they are, nevertheless, always there for each other.

Instead, it's bizarrely reminiscent of ""Alien,"" in that the entire cast is older, seasoned, and no longer the wild party-going folk audiences would expect of them. While there are laugh-out-loud moments, the more substantial themes of life-altering change, staying true to oneself, and recognizing the power of friendship, are dark and serious. Once the dilemmas hit and the lead character begins her downward spiral, the joke-a-minute pacing from the introduction is lost  reflection, problem solving, reparation, and forgiveness replace the humor, along with lengthy scenes of drunkenness or bad decisions that simply aren't that humorous. Annie (Kristen Wiig) has just lost her bakery ""Cake Baby,"" is forced to move in with an incredibly weird brother and sister team, is barely able to pay her bills, and drives a car clearly on its last legs. She thinks she's reached rock bottom when her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) announces her engagement. Annie is to be the Maid of Honor, and must put aside her personal quagmires to deal with the responsibilities of organizing a wedding shower and bachelorette party. She's in for a shock when she meets the other bridesmaids, a colorful mix of dysfunctional women: Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), a loud-mouthed mother of filthy-mouthed children; Becca (Ellie Kemper), a simple girl with far too few worldly experiences; Megan (Melissa McCarthy), an overly obnoxious manhunter; and Helen (Rose Byrne), a ludicrously wealthy socialite. Helen poses the biggest problem  unbeknownst to Annie, Lillian has become very close to the prettier, richer, skinnier woman, and immediately a feud is formed. Annie wants to prove to her best friend that she's every bit as good as Helen, but Helen's plentiful assets allow for better partying, bigger gifts, and superior treatment, especially when it comes to a wedding dress, a trip to Paris, and a luxurious manor location for the shower. Despite the helpful distraction of bonhomous Wisconsin state trooper Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd), who is incontestably the perfect match for Annie, she can't seem to top her rival, please her longtime confidant, or get out of the rut that is her completely depressing life. Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph are decent actresses, but far from leading lady material. Since the film was written by Wiig, it's likely that the story and script are heavily influenced by her point of view, attributing to giving her the blame when the dialogue tries to be representational of candid girlfriend conversations, a la ""Sex and the City's"" routine meal-oriented get-togethers, yet lacks funniness or naturalness. The supporting cast frequently takes away the spotlight, being comprised of character actors scrounged up from ""The Office,"" ""Reno 911!,"" ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"" ""Mike & Molly,"" ""Mad Men,"" ""Damages,"" ""Come Fly with Me"" and more, but can't hide the saddening aspect of roles competing to be more pathetic and engage in more embarrassing activities (the best of which involves a food poisoning ordeal) while being filled"

At first glance, it appears to be your usual romantic comedy about female friends planning a wedding. Fortunately, as familiar as Bridesmaids may seem in terms of plothow many ""chick flicks"" have there been about weddings?it's enriched by the writers' exploration of three-dimensional characters, who just happen to be women. The movie doesn't treat its female characters as exceptions to the absurd comedic rule that women aren't funny, but for moviegoers devoted to that archaic idea, it will certainly prove them wrong. Here the current SNL regular Wiig advances beyond the title's implication and graduates from television regular to movie star, her performance so assured and likable that it's bound to secure her another feature film lead role in the near future. Wiig plays Annie, who's asked by Lillian (Maya Rudolph) to be her maid of honor. Friends since childhood, the two have gone in different directions. Lillian's well-to-do fiance (a silent Tim Heidecker) and newfound moneyed friends are much different that Annie's down-to-earth, minimum-wage style. Approaching rock bottom, Annie's bakery business has gone under, she lives with weirdo bother-sister roommates, works a lousy job, her car barely runs, and she degrades herself as the regular booty call for a man who refuses to commit (Jon Hamm). In the face of all this, Annie feels upstaged by Lillian's new friend and bridesmaid, Helen (Rose Byrne, excellent as usual), an elitist with deep pockets and no end of sophistication. Wiig, an expert at passive-aggressive humor, places Annie in a backhanded battle with Helen over who can conceive the best ideas for Lillian's wedding. Of course, Helen's outwardly graceful and modish touch trumps Annie, who chooses the wrong restaurant (leading to a gross-out food poisoning sequence) and singlehandedly screws up the bachelorette party. With Annie's personal life in shambles, no wonder Lillian makes the switch halfway through the proceedings to have Helen take charge as the maid of honor. Meanwhile, Annie flirts with a nice-guy state trooper (Chris O'Dowd), whose sweetness is overlooked by the self-pitying protagonist.

Recalling the struggle of Jason Segel's character in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Wiig's character must find a way out of her rut, whereas her downward spiral consumes most of the film and becomes increasingly funny and affecting as Annie's behavior worsens. Yet, despite the lows reached, Wiig remains strangely sympathetic, even in her worst moments. We may cringe at her poor behavior, but the actress never loses the audience's compassion, no matter how badly she screws up.

Her bakery recently folded and she lost a lot of money, so she's working an awful jewelry-store job her mom (Jill Clayburgh in her final role) got her as a favor. She lives with two weird British siblings (Matt Lucas and scene-stealing Rebel Wilson) where she's behind on the rent. Her mom is nice, but their relationship is a little fraught. And the guy she's ""seeing,"" Ted (an uncredited  and hilarious  Jon Hamm), is a total prick. So it's no surprise she is not entirely pleased that her best friend since childhood, Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is getting married. And she's even less pleased to learn that, through the engagement, Lillian has gained entry into a world of country-club membership, tennis matches and couture from which she has been kept away. This world is the natural home of Helen (Rose Byrne), Lillian's new best friend, whom Annie hates on sight. Annie is the maid of honor  but who is she really? This is not the question one expects a movie, sold as a knockabout comedy for lady-people produced by Judd Apatow, to be asking. It's unexpected and really unsatisfying, mostly because the script by Ms. Wiig and Annie Mumolo completely ignores the movie's major issue: class. Annie hasn't been able to afford to replace the broken taillights on her unwashed car for more than a year. The friendly cop who pulls her over, Officer Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd, a charming Irish comedian who really should have gone to the trouble of an American accent), remembers her shop and lets her off. But she still has to give tips on how to get it started to a valet at a cocktail party to which she's not wearing a cocktail dress. She brings the bridal group to a Brazilian restaurant (more on which later) because there you get a lot for your money. Worst of all, when the group overrides Annie's suggestions and decides to go to Vegas, she's the only one who has to fly coach. This extended airplane sequence actually has Helen and Lillian sip champagne in first class and complain about Annie's pride in refusing to let them upgrade her ticket. With friends like these, are we truly meant to believe Annie's only problem is her own attitude? Director Paul Feig, a TV sitcom veteran, chooses to film most of the scenes in two-shots with a lot of cutting back and forth between talking heads. So even when the women are meant to be together, they are still isolated. Annie's working-class status is emphasized by the places she goes with Officer Rhodes  a convenience store, a highway lay-by, a corner bar  as compared to Ted's fancy house, Helen's stables and Lillian's country club. Helen and Annie interact by trying to one-up each other for Lillian's affections. The only other bridesmaid Annie talks with is Megan (Melissa McCarthy), Lillian's new sister-in-law and the only other person in the movie"
205,LEC_Doc5_Bridesmaids,LEC_Doc5_Bridesmaids,LEC,Comedy,Positive,Bridesmaids,"I'm going to start this review with a time saver, with two words that serve as a litmus test of whether or not ""Bridesmaids"" is for you. If you read them and giggle, by all means, go see this film. If you read them and make a face like you smell something foul and rancid, you'll want to sit this one out. And these two words are...sink diarrhea. If I still have your attention, now we can talk about ""Bridesmaids"". When you walk into a movie directed by Paul Feig and produced by Judd Apatow, you know pretty much what you're going to get. There will be an ensemble cast of collected miscreants, crude humor of the dick and fart variety, and gems of off-the-cuff comedic improvisation. For a while the story will truck along, full of shenanigans and poop jokes, then it will take a serious turn when the two central figures decide they don't want to be friends anymore, or break up if the film is more romantic in tone, and everything wraps up with some heavy-handed resolution where everybody hugs. It's a formula for sure, but one that met with great success in ""Superbad"", ""Knocked Up"", and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", among others. Those movies are funny as hell, and you're not watching them for story anyway, you're watching them for boner jokes. ""Bridesmaids"" falls into this same category, though admittedly, with fewer actual boner jokes. Initially, I was afraid that ""Bridesmaids"" was going to be atrocious. Part of this I chalk up to Krisen Wiig, the star and co-writer. I just don't like her, never have. I couldn't stand her on ""Saturday Night Live"", and everything she's done since has met with a similar reaction. There's something about her demeanor and delivery that, not only isn't funny, but actually makes me mad most of the time. Basically, I'm not a fan. The other part of my worry stemmed from the fact that set up is so tired, so fucking hackneyed, that it's painful. Imagine every romantic comedy or sitcom ever made about marriage and you know the story. Wiig plays Annie. Her lifelong best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) announces that she's going to get married and wants Annie to be her maid of honor. There is drama with the other bridesmaids. Annie's life is in the crapper, she has a creepy roommate who reads her diary, and she feels like she's drifting away from Lillian. ""Bridesmaids"" meanders on like this for a while, driving home the fact that Annie is unlucky in business, love, and life. There are some light chuckles, the best of which are obviously spontaneous moments between Wiig and Rudolph, who do have a nice chemistry, but you dread where this is going next. Then a funny thing happens, ""Bridesmaids"" gets good, really good. The turning point is the scene that combines trying on bridesmaid's dresses and an intense bout of collective food poisoning. There is excellent, and inventive use of both vomit and"

The comedy, which he produced and was directed by friend and fellow Freaks and Geeks creator Paul Feig, is only sporadically funny and leans too heavily on the Apatow formula. You know, the story of the outsider/ne're-do-well with a good heart who faces big obstacles on his/her way to happiness. And as good as Wiig is in Bridesmaids, the comedy is hardly a launching point for her career from Saturday Night Live and scenestealing small roles in films to that of lead actress. Wiig is Annie, a good-hearted woman in the dumps over just about everything in her life. Her baking business failed  she has to see the shuttered store just about every day. Her boyfriend left her, so she finds solace in the arms of Ted (Jon Hamm in a small but funny role), who makes it abundantly clear he's only using her for sex, and she isn't even his first option. She hates her job selling jewelry. Oh, and she learns her best friend since about being single and left behind and embraces her role as Lillian's maid of honor. Then she finds unwanted competition as BFF with the beautiful and perfect Helen (Rose Byrne), who has only known Lillian for eight months. Their awkward tension leads to some funny moments, such as dueling speeches at an engagement party over how much Lillian's friendship means. Life gets sunnier for Annie after she meets nice-guy cop Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd). But her neuroses  of which there are many  foil the budding relationship. It gets worse as Annie loses her job, is evicted by her roommates, and is in jeopardy of losing her friendship with Lillian, even as Helen asserts hers. Mixed in with this are the bridesmaids, populated by the usual Apatow assortment of quirky characters as comic relief. There's goody-goody Becca (Ellie Kemper), downtrodden wife looking for an escape Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), and crass Megan (scene stealer Melissa McCarthy of TV's Mike & Molly in a Zach Galifianakis-type role). The women pop in and out of scenes to jolt the comedy, most especially McCarthy, who proves fearless when it comes to crass humor. And yes, with Apatow attached to the movie, there are bodily function jokes galore, especially when Annie takes Lillian and the bridesmaids to a dive restaurant an hour before a dress fitting. Let your imagination go from there and you'll probably still not take the scene as far as the film does. Suffice to say, Mike & Molly fans will never look at McCarthy the same again. Wiig makes for an appealing lead. She's cute, funny, smart, and, like McCarthy, fearless in whatever it takes to get a laugh. You can't ask for much more than that from a comedic actress. But as a screenwriter  Wiig wrote this along with Annie Mumolo"
207,LEC_Doc7_Bridesmaids,LEC_Doc7_Bridesmaids,LEC,Comedy,Positive,Bridesmaids,"Here comes the bride. Again. After last weekend's prenuptial comedies  ""Jumping the Broom"" and ""Something Borrowed""  it's easy to greet ""Bridesmaids"" as if it were golden. This romp about a crazed maid of honor and a fairly sane bride has enough titters and laughs by comparison that it's tempting to send bouquets its way when the movie is mostly randy, guilty fun. When we first meet Annie (Kristen Wiig), she's weathering a setback that could make any gal (or guy, for that matter) wobbly. She's lost her beloved business, a bakery. She's also . . . well, ""dating"" is too generous a word for the bedroom acrobatics (no strings attached) she and sex-buddy Ted perform. ""Make room for someone who's nice to you,"" best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) tells Annie at one point. No kidding. Jon Hamm of ""Mad Men"" takes pleasure in playing Ted as an amoral (albeit honest about it) cad. A storm surge likely to swamp Annie's listing self-esteem comes when Lillian announces she's getting married. It's not that Annie feels left out. ""Bridesmaids"" isn't a sad-sack spinster comedy, exactly. But Lillian has a new friend, the wife of her fiance's boss, and Helen (Rose Byrne) has the means to do for Lillian's wedding what Annie can't. Mishaps abound as Annie vies with Helen for a position in Lillian's life she already owns. While the script (written by Wiig and Annie Mumolo) avoids making Helen outright evil, she is not without fault. Is the lovely, pearl-wearing Helen one-upping Annie at every turn? In last year's ""Get Him to the Greek,"" Byrne hinted she has a game sense of humor. Here she proves herself a pretty/funny woman. Caught between Annie and Helen are three other bridesmaids. Zaftig funny lady Melissa McCarthy of TV's ""Mike & Molly"" stands out as Megan. Is the joke her weight? Her lust? If we think it's either, the joke is on us. Romantic possibility comes in by way of Rhodes. The cop with a loamy accent and fine sense of the absurd is played by an appealing Chris O'Dowd. Onetime ""Saturday Night Live"" castmates Wiig and Rudolph make Annie and Lillian's friendship believable. Which is why Annie's shenanigans are sad  and hilarious. What if some other gal came between Laverne and Shirley? Or Lucy and Ethel? There would be mayhem. There would also be tears. And if Lucille Ball were making comedies in the age of Judd Apatow and Chelsea Handler, there'd be side-splitting use of bodily fluids and anatomically obsessed humor. ""Bridesmaids"" has all of the above  and a musical number."
208,LEC_Doc8_Bridesmaids,LEC_Doc8_Bridesmaids,LEC,Comedy,Negative,Bridesmaids,"Since American Pie and Farrelly brothers' hits such as There's Something About Mary, the pitfalls of love and sex have been steadily upstaged by the cinema of bodily embarrassment. The supposedly hilarious consequences of mistimed ejaculation, defecation and regurgitation are no longer restricted to movies about the misadventures of the high school set. With help from Judd Apatow's ""bromances"", they've broken through the age barrier and there's no stopping them. Gender is no bar, either. In Bridesmaids, the latest Apatow production, the main setpiece takes place in a bridal salon, which is thrown into chaos when the bride and her retinue suffer food poisoning during their dress fittings, causing an outbreak of fart jokes. The film was co-written by its star, Kristen Wiig, a graduate of Saturday Night Live. Her fellow SNL regular, Maya Rudolph, is cast as the bride and the whole thing plays like a string of television sketches pasted together. Nonetheless, there's an attempt to wind these hard-working gags around the semblance of a plot. Wiig's Annie has hit a low point. Her bakery business has failed, her boyfriend has flown and she's trying to pay the rent with a boring sales job in a jewellery store where she tends to frighten off the customers. Engaged couples suddenly change their minds about buying a ring after she has delivered her musings about the fleeting nature of love and fidelity. In her off-duty hours, she's having sex with Mad Men's Jon Hamm, which ought to be a good thing, but he's playing a jerk, a word that can also describe his sexual technique. He and Annie are out of synch on all counts. When her dearest friend, Lillian (Rudolph), announces that she is getting married to her long-standing boyfriend, Doug (Tim Heidecker), Annie makes a show of being happy for her. After all, she's to be maid of honour. But she feels as if she is losing her last friend - a fear that becomes more acute when she meets Lillian's new friend, the immaculate but highly strung Helen (Rose Byrne), who is married to Doug's wealthy boss. Helen has great faith in her own taste and the money to indulge it, and she's determined to take over the wedding arrangements. This is the last straw for Annie and in no time she is transformed into a delinquent bridesmaid. As the pre-wedding rituals unfold, she manages to sabotage them all. At times, the damage is done unwittingly but it hardly matters. The effect is equally cringe-worthy. The film is directed by Paul Feig, creator of another Apatow production, the TV show Freaks and Geeks, and the supporting cast is made up of stand-up comics who have made their way in showbiz via Los Angeles' improv clubs. They all bring a dogged determination to making their characters as loopy as possible. There's Megan (Melissa McCarthy), who looks and behaves as if she were Ricky Gervais's sister, Becca (Ellie Kemper), the wide-eyed innocent, who is newly married to a man"
209,LEC_Doc9_Bridesmaids,LEC_Doc9_Bridesmaids,LEC,Comedy,Positive,Bridesmaids,"When you hear the title Bridesmaids and see a poster that features six women in pink dresses, it's easy to expect a certain type of film. Hollywood tosses out at least one or two virtually interchangeable wedding-themed chick flicks every year. Most of them aren't very good, and usually they involve some impossibly gorgeous ""loser"" (such as Kate Hudson or Katherine Heigl) fretting about how she can't find Mr. Right like her about-to-be-married best friend/sister has. This being the case, it's important for me to make clear from the start that Bridesmaids is about as far from a dopey Kate Hudson/Katherine Heigl rom-com as you can get. It is smart where those other pictures are dumb, perceptive where the others are cliched. Kristen Wiig plays Annie, a woman in her thirties whose life is a train wreck. She's dating a jerk (Jon Hamm) who uses her for sex. A nice-guy cop (Chris O'Dowd) wants to romance her, but her fear of rejection keeps him at arm's length. Her baking business has failed, leaving her buried in debt. She shares a home with two super-weird roommates because she can't afford to live on her own. Her best  and, really, only  friend is Lillian (Maya Rudolph). When Lillian unexpectedly gets engaged, Annie is secretly devastated, as she knows it will leave her a little more on her own. Nevertheless, she agrees to serve as maid of honor. The other bridesmaids are a diverse lot that she can't quite make heads or tails of. There's the rich, snooty Helen (Rose Byrne), who competes with Annie to be the center of attention; harried mother Dana (Reno 911's Wendy McLendon-Covey), who is looking for a wild time; the naive and innocent Becca (Ellie Kemper from ""The Office); and Megan, the horniest, most butch woman you are ever likely to see. (She's played by former ""Gilmore Girls"" co-star Melissa McCarthy, who walks off with every single scene she's in.) Annie plans a trip to Vegas for the bachelorette party, but her neuroses get in the way, causing everything to turn into a complete disaster. She even manages to alienate Lillian. Bridesmaids was produced by Judd Apatow, and although he didn't write or direct it (Paul Feig directed, while Wiig and Annie Mumolo penned the screenplay), the film is very similar in tone to his The 40 Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. It has plenty of moments of outrageous humor, most notably a scene in which the ladies experience the effects of food poisoning while attending a dress-fitting session. At the same time, it also grounds that humor in something deeper and more character-driven. Bridesmaids is not just two hours of women engaging in pre-wedding shenanigans; it's a comic story about how Annie hits her bottom, faces the unpleasant truths about herself, and realizes it's time to get her act together. That kind of theme is easy to tackle in a drama. Bridesmaids does it as a comedy, which is much more difficult. In fact,"
210,LEC_Doc10_Bridesmaids,LEC_Doc10_Bridesmaids,LEC,Comedy,Negative,Bridesmaids,"I may not be the ideal candidate to review a female-driven comedy such as ""Bridesmaids,"" whose comic high point is the bride crapping in the middle of the street in her gown. There were a substantial number of people (some of them women) chortling loudly at this overlong, awkward attempt to fuse gross-out humor (a la ""The Hangover"") with you-go-girl sentimentality at the screening I attended last week. And not all of them had been out celebrating Cinco de Mayo. I was among a sizable minority who laughed only occasionally, and periodically checked their watches (a good number of women sat in stony silence throughout). By the time two hours had dragged by, I felt a lot like I had sat through a five-hour wedding. Part of this, I think, is how you respond not only to the nonstop assault of vulgarity  this is from the Judd Apatow atelier  but to Kristen Wiig, a talented ""Saturday Night Live"" regular who has previously only appeared in small parts in movies. For me, she's an overwhelming personality who works better in small doses. Wiig, who co-wrote the script, has given herself a huge, ambitious part that she handles well in some scenes, not so great in others. She plays a failed bakeshop owner who hates her part-time job at a jewelry store and is sinking ever deeper into alcoholism, depression and rage. In short, Wiig's borderline-sociopath is the last person that her BFF, Maya Rudolph, would, or should, choose as the maid of honor for her impending nuptials. The bottom begins falling out shortly after our heroine meets the motley collection of other bridesmaids, most notably a wealthy, control-freak new confidante of Rudolph's (Rose Byrne) who would like nothing better than to stage a coup and take over as maid of honor. A ladies luncheon at a downscale Spanish restaurant picked by Wiig before gown fittings leads to an orgy of projectile vomiting and defecation, both in a sink and on the street. The screenwriters told my colleague Sara Stewart this was producer Apatow's brainstorm  he seems to believe that women among themselves behave every bit as grossly as men. Maybe it's the romantic in me, but I'd sure like to think this is not really true. Wiig finally gets replaced by Byrne after a booze- and drug-fueled episode on a pre-wedding jaunt to Las Vegas. Further drunken chaos that she triggers at the bridal shower gets her banned from the ceremony altogether. In real life, Rudolph would probably get an order of protection. Anyone with the slightest knowledge of chick flicks will be able to figure out where things go from there. One of my biggest issues with this movie is how the script (co-credited to Annie Mumolo) and director (Apatow acolyte Paul Feig) clumsily toggle between the Wiig character's serious, fairly realistic issues  including her lack of money after she inevitably gets fired  and the more farcical elements. Rudolph's bridegroom barely makes an appearance. Wiig"
211,MBC_Doc1_Step_Brothers,MBC_Doc1_Step_Brothers,MBC,Comedy,Positive,Step_Brothers,"Your ability to enjoy ""Step Brothers,"" the latest flick from the team of Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, with newly favored sidekick John C. Reilly along for the ride, rests almost entirely upon your past ability to enjoy such Ferrell man-child flicks as ""Talladega Nights,"" ""Elf,"" ""Old School"" and others. If you enjoyed these films, then odds are you will find yourself consistently entertained by ""Step Brothers."" If, however, you find Ferrell's man-child shtick a bit old and tiresome then there's nothing in this film that will change your mind. I count myself as a Ferrell fan, and while ""Step Brothers"" isn't his best work it is Ferrell doing what Ferrell does best...combining a man-child persona into a completely unrealistic storyline that goes way over-the-top and yet still manages to be a bit warm and fuzzy. Ferrell excels at playing characters who do things that most of us would never have the balls to do, but they're such nice guys that it's impossible to hold any of it against them. In ""Step Brothers,"" Ferrell plays Brennan, a 39-year-old perpetual child who still lives at home with his mother (Mary Steenburgen, ""Elf"") for reasons that are only mildly explored. Brennan's mom meets a man, Dr. Doback (Richard Jenkins, ""The Kingdom""), with his own 40-year-old son at home, Dale (John C. Reilly). The two single parents decide to get married and, of course, chaos ensues when the two households are combined. Throw into the mix Brennan's highly successful older brother (Adam Scott, ""The Great Buck Howard) and his perpetually frustrated wife (Kathryn Hahn, ""Crossing Jordan"") and you have the makings for a typical over-the-top, boundary pushing flick from Ferrell/McKay. It would be difficult to summarize just how far over-the-top Ferrell goes with ""Step Brothers"" without giving away too many of the film's best scenes, but suffice it to say that ""Step Brothers"" contains everything from musical interludes to scrotal drumming to ""Benchwarmers"" style kid on adult violence to a music video that you will likely completely hate but completely unable to erase from your memory. In other words, it's typical Ferrell. From Ferrell's early days on ""Saturday Night Live,"" he and McKay have been a solid gold comedy team. The two wrote together on SNL and have co-written ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights"" while McKay also directed both films. McKay and Ferrell have a strong chemistry, and McKay seems to have a knack for catching the best of Ferrell, both improvised and staged, on film. ""Step Brothers,"" however, is a bit of a mixed bag. While the film is undeniably funny, at least for those who have consistently enjoyed Ferrell's brand of comedy, so much of the material in ""Step Brothers"" feels familiar that that laughs don't come quite as hard as they once did with Ferrell's earlier cinematic work. The film works best when it feels like Ferrell's improvising, and doesn't quite gel when the script feels like it's trying to force its way through Ferrell's typical pattern of lovable loser, merry"
212,MBC_Doc2_Step_Brothers,MBC_Doc2_Step_Brothers,MBC,Comedy,Positive,Step_Brothers,"In an alternate, perhaps less amusing universe, Mike Leigh has just directed a film in which two developmentally disabled middle-aged men become stepbrothers, learning to love each other and respect themselves in the process. David Thewlis and Timothy Spall star, and by the end of the movie I want to hug my mother and/or die. But for now we are moored to this version of existence, where the cinema of mental handicaps is typically confined to comedies in which ""retarded"" is a cheap insult instead of the clinical diagnosis it should be. Thus, Adam McKay has just directed Step Brothers, a film about two mewling, delusional infants trapped in the bodies of Brennan Huff (Will Ferrell) and Dale Doback (John C. Reilly). When their respective single parents get married and merge families, they are forced to share a house, a room and a layabout lifestyle. It's a tad problematic, a mite disturbing and immensely funny. The touched man-child is a comedy staple. Chaplin, Keaton, Tati and Sellers braided physical grace and a near-autistic inability to comprehend or defend the effects of their actions. The beauty of movement spoke for them, balancing the chaos in their wake and constituting a profound, wordless articulation of empathy. Ferrell and his goofball cabalReilly, McKay, Judd Apatow, Steve Carell, Jon Heder, et al.have perfected a less sophisticated but nearly as transcendent trick: The leading stooges have bodies just as muddled and intractable as the minds inside of them. Watching Elf or Napoleon Dynamite or The 40-Year-Old Virgin can at times feel like flipping through casebooks of neurological disease, but by neglecting to identify the apparent disabilities of their lovable losers, these films successfully (rightly? wrongly?) exploit a repressed urge to laugh at brain-damaged antics. Step Brothers marks the apotheosis of this sly, troubling tactic. It is also the best film Ferrell and company have made since Anchorman. Excepting some cursory coitus, which plays out like the invention of a new fetishone that involves commiseration over doofus children as a lubricantMary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins don't have much to do in their parental roles. They simply get out of the way, stand in a corner with logic and reason, and let Brennan and Dale destroy everything around them. The film would work just as well, if not better, with Jackass-style introductions to the inspired carnage: ""I'm John C. Reilly, and this is Chewbacca Mask."" Or: ""I'm Will Ferrell, and this is Homemade Bunkbed."" And: ""This is Tea-Bag Drumset."" Because that's what Step Brothers amounts to: a series of inspired set pieces strung on the barest string of a story that is totally beside the point. In fact, the film suffers when plot intrudes. The first half is a wonder of sheer surreal lunacy, as Brennan and Dale fight and wreak havoc before they become BFFs and wreak more havoc. The formulaic plotting that burdens the last act with soul-searching and reconciliation is like penance for the glorious sins of the first hour, which, if you can"
213,MBC_Doc3_Step_Brothers,MBC_Doc3_Step_Brothers,MBC,Comedy,Positive,Step_Brothers,"MIGHT I be allowed a few moments' indulgence to argue that Step Brothers, in which Will Ferrell and John C Reilly play middle-aged 10-year-olds, is less of a broad comedy than a profound exercise in old-fashioned surrealism? Think about it. The film finds the two unemployed losers being pressed together after Will's mom and Reilly's dad marry one another. Obsessed with loud rock music and big boobies, the two bicker like babies and take every opportunity to reveal their pathological immaturity. Watch as Will rubs his testicles on John's drum kit. Laugh as teenage bullies beat the lads up. Yet the film, otherwise a standard, quasi-naturalistic Frat Pack affair, makes no serious attempt to acknowledge the leads' apparent learning difficulties. And what's all this with Mary Steenburgen (born 1953) playing the mother of Will Ferrell (born 1967)? It's just like a Bunuel film. Isn't it? Well, no. Not really. Step Brothersis the latest movie from Adam McKay, the director of Anchorman and Talladega Nights, and, like those two fine entertainments, it rejoices in making a virtue of its own rampant stupidity. Long used to playing childlike men, Ferrell is here offered the opportunity to boil his stock character down to its gibbering essence. Meanwhile, Reilly, who has recently found a way of using his crushed vulnerability for comic purposes, knocks together a character that conveys the coiled violence that lurks within many children. In the course of the film they run through all the traumas of early adolescence and, exploiting the comedy of discordance to the full, make something fresh and amusing of every one. Both actors, aware that the film does have a point to make about modern men and their unwillingness to grow up, allow just enough middle-aged misery to creep in without tipping the film into total absurdity. The key performances may, however, come from Richard Jenkins and Mary Steenburgen as the parents. All comic sketches require a stooge to stand by in bewilderment and make aghast comments at the antics of the principal comedian. Richard and Mary approach the task in variously effective ways. Whereas Steenburgen registers genuine sorrow at the boys' occasional crises - even shedding real tears at one point - Jenkins is the only person allowed to share the audience's bewilderment at the unfolding lunacy. When the lads finally make friends, they rush into their folks' bedroom and propose turning their beds into bunks. This way, Will explains, they can do more ""activities"". Only Jenkins seems to realise the oddness of the situation. ""You're adults, you can do what you want,"" he wails. The awareness that just one character knows the universe is out of kilter adds another layer of delightful absurdity to proceedings. So rather than being a surreal masterpiece, Step Brothersis a classic of lowbrow humour? That analysis doesn't really hold up either. It is a continuing frustration that the collaborations between Ferrell and McKay always look as if (appropriately for this project) they were written by two inattentive teenagers after"
214,MBC_Doc4_Step_Brothers,MBC_Doc4_Step_Brothers,MBC,Comedy,Positive,Step_Brothers,"THERE have been many great pairings in American film comedy - Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, Bob Hope and Bing Crosby - but none quite like Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. Those others could talk fast and crack wise; they knew their way around a well-written line and they could fall like acrobats. On the other hand, none could muster a 20-second fart like Reilly nor make so much mirth as Ferrell sitting on the toilet, realising there's no toilet paper. Step Brothers has both of these delights. Between occasional guffaws and more frequent hand-over-mouth, oh-my-God moments, I started to think about where American comedy has come from and where it's going. How could the industry that produced Bringing Up Baby, Some Like It Hot and Raising Arizona have found its way to Step Brothers - a movie that's equal parts foul air and dead air, a sort of extended improvisation session by two guys who think that scratching their testicles is a punchline? Even by their own standards, Step Brothers is a stink bomb, a colossal indulgence. These two - with this director - made a funny and successful movie together in Talladega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby. It was vulgar but kind of sweet; the story of the troubled friendship of two dopey NASCAR drivers who raced, partied and did stupid things together (""shake and bake"", Reilly kept saying, as if it meant something). Step Brothers has many of the same elements but no discipline about what works and what doesn't. The ultimate aim is just to go too far; to see how naughty they can be and get away with it. It's true that American film comedy has never been so vulgar as it is now. The fart joke reigns supreme; poo is very popular, as is vomit, sperm, snot and spit. Movies make jokes about camel toes (don't ask), killing animals, beating up grannies and children, getting one's penis caught in one's zipper and, especially, masturbation. In Step Brothers, Ferrell gets to lick dog poo and rub his testicles (his ""nutsack"" as he prefers to call it) all over a cherished drum set belonging to his new stepbrother (played by Reilly). The testicles get a close-up and are reportedly some sort of prosthesis (oh my, I hope so). Ferrell and Reilly play a couple of 40-year-old children. Brennan Huff (Ferrell) and Dale Doback (Reilly) have to share a room when Nancy Huff (Mary Steenburgen) marries Dr Robert Doback (Richard Jenkins). These are indulgent parents but their boys are the monsters that ate Star Wars: full-grown men with the socialisation of lazy 13-year-old brats.

215,MBC_Doc5_Step_Brothers,MBC_Doc5_Step_Brothers,MBC,Comedy,Positive,Step_Brothers,"In this Judd Apatow-produced comedy Will Ferrell and John C Reilly play Brennan and Dale, two spoilt, porno-reading, TV-ogling child-men. Well there's a surprise. Isn't every US comedy these days about just such a winning type: the immature loser? Apatow is the man responsible for some of the most successful comedies of recent years: The 40 Year Old Virgin, Superbad and Knocked Up. Clearly, arrested development is his thing but isn't it time for us all to move on? There's just one problem. Dude, the film so totally happens to be great. Ferrell and Reilly co-wrote the script with director Adam McKay. Which is to say, they pretty much ad-libbed the whole thing and, while some of the jokes fall flat, or outstay their welcome, most possess a crazed energy and astuteness that suggest the team put a lot of thought into this ""no-brainer"". The film begins with a wedding between two successful, good-natured fiftysomethings, Nancy and Robert (the wonderful Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins). This union spells big changes for their respective stay-at-home offspring. Brennan (39) and Dale (40) will now have to share a room and, naturally, they're not best pleased. Dale is a pugnacious show-off. Brennan is a weeper (watching Dale make Brennan cry on their first evening together is a joy). These actors obviously know their characters inside and out. We feel like intimates, too. Brennan and Dale are larger-than-life and very familiar: helpless despots, always on the brink of a meltdown. When the step-brothers both start sleepwalking things get really weird; when they kick Robert down the stairs we realise this a screwball farce that knows exactly when and why to get serious. There is a plot. Brennan's golden-boy younger brother (think Tom Cruise on Oprah Winfrey) offers to sell the family home so that Robert and Nancy can afford to sail round the world on their beloved yacht. This crisis forces the ""bros"" to unite and try all sorts of shenanigans, including going for ""team"" interviews and setting up a business that exploits their hard-to-pinpoint talents. Step Brothers remains focused, however, on that central tension between the boys and their apparently doting parents. As in Frank Capra's Arsenic and Old Lace, family life is hysterical  that is to say, full of hysteria. Have Robert and Nancy made their children mad, or are they simply trying to make the best of having mad children? Brennan and Dale swear like troopers and gradually infect their parents (""What the f***ing f***?"" yells Nancy). The film was rated ""Restricted"" in the US, where the veteran critic Roger Ebert has bemoaned its crudeness. He claims the film ""lowers the civility of our civilisation"". But since when has home been sweet? Arthouse films are allowed to show life warts and all. Why not mainstream comedies? Nor is nastiness per se condoned. Apatow's brand of humour owes something to the cruel Farrelly brothers but far more to the Weitz siblings, who made the infinitely kind American Pie. There are no"

The story of two overgrown adolescents who become sudden kin when their single parents marry, it's ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" with two 40-year-old virgins, ""Knocked Up"" without the knocking up. Produced by Apatow and directed by McKay, who co-wrote the script with Ferrell, ""Step Brothers"" is not a retread so much as a reduction, stripping away the magical pretext of ""Elf"" and the period trappings of ""Anchorman"" to get to the heart of the thriving man-boy genre. The movie's characters don't just act like children; for all intents and purposes, they are. Apart from their thinning hair and doughy torsos, Dale (John C. Reilly) and Brennan (Will Ferrell) are the spitting images of early-'80s adolescence. Dressed in worn ""Star Wars"" tees, they cherish their samurai swords and drum kits, happily sponging off the parents who have spent the last quarter-century searching for the right way to shove them out of the nest. When Brennan's mom (Mary Steenburgen) and Dale's dad (Richard Jenkins) shack up, their sons are forced to share a room, which leads inevitably to conflict since neither boy is used to sharing anything at all. Dale, the more obstreperous and sullen of the pair, verbally pounds on his unwanted roommate. Brennan gets back at Dale by befouling his precious drums in a manner consistent with adolescent boyhood and Apatow movies. Territorial markings aside, Dale and Brennan soon find out they have more in common than not, including an intense dislike of Brennan's younger brother Derek (Adam Scott), an oily, insincere executive at a helicopter-charter firm with sculpted abs and a Bluetooth. Unctuous, brutish and self-involved, Derek has the monstrousness of Ferrell's characters in ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights"" without any of their redeeming innocence. It's the movie's plum part and Scott runs mightily with it, creating a character so pure in his venality that you can't help but admire his determination even as you pray for his painful demise. For Dale and Brennan, Derek serves as a nightmare vision of adulthood, a loser's caricature of what it takes to win. If that's success, who wouldn't prefer to fail? Not all of ""Step Brothers' "" grown-ups are so frightening. Steenburgen and Jenkins play the newlyweds with genuine love and appropriate anxiety, so you can feel the bonds between them fray as their children's behavior takes its toll on their marriage. Kathryn Hahn plays Derek's long-suffering wife with a pinched despair that erupts into a passionate obsession with Dale after he punches her husband square in the mouth. Their furtive, creepy affair hits the movie's darkest and weirdest notes. Ferrell and Reilly have a grand time acting like kids. After watching Reilly deliver an entire monologue clad in a rubber Chewbacca mask, one can only wish that he had gotten the chance to unleash his inner goofball sooner."
217,MBC_Doc7_Step_Brothers,MBC_Doc7_Step_Brothers,MBC,Comedy,Negative,Step_Brothers,"Credit the makers of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly's silly, crass comedy with carrying the ""Step Brothers"" gag as far as they do before backsliding into a finale that lets an absurd conceit turn slack. Actually, the duo themselves are the goofball brains behind this lark, along with Ferrell's partner in comedy, director-writer Adam McKay. Last seen onscreen as best friends, then NASCAR frenemies in McKay's ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,"" Ferrell and Reilly play Brennan Huff and Dale Doback, two layabouts forced to live under one roof when their single parents fall in love and marry. While the actors don't really look alike, there is something symbiotically je nais se quoi about them that makes the setup delicious. They play well against each other. More gifted  comedically and dramatically  than the material finally accommodates, they still deliver moments of deft timing and stoopid laughs. The sharpest writing comes quickly when Nancy Huff and Dr. Robert Doback meet at a medical conference and Brennan and Dale get to know-hate each other. What could have been a heated booty call becomes something deeper when each learns the other has a grown-up son still living at home. Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins bring sweet, calibrated gravitas to the two successful parents confounded by their boys. And the movie teases denial and enabling. Only child Dale is the meaner one. But they're both off their tiny rockers. Brennan's retaliatory strike against Dale's beloved drum set proves he can give as good as he gets. It's also an appalling nod to the jests of Judd Apatow, one of the comedy's producers. Much of the fun comes in watching two developmentally arrested 12- year-olds go at it in 40-year-old bodies. Their stunted vocabulary makes a furious, fresh discovery of cursing, with f-bombs nearly decimating the R-rated script. When they first meet on a suburban lawn like gunslingers, Dale sports a black T-shirt with Yoda peering out. Brennan wears a just-as-retro Pablo Cruise tee. Who needs sartorial splendor? Clothes unmake the man. Early on, someone asks Dale what he does. ""Manage a baseball team,"" he answers. ""Little League?"" ""Fantasy."" Not to smear the gamesmanship of millions of avid fantasy sport aficionados, but in the case of these boneheads, the Neverland aspect is all too clear. Dale and Brennan are Peter Pans gone to seed. Neither one works. They live in a world dreamed up by popular culture. Wendys, plural, show up in the guise of overly desperate stepsister-in-law Alice (Kathryn Hahn) and, later, Brennan's appalled therapist. Played by Adam Scott, Brennan's younger brother Derek is a name-dropping success at selling corporate helicopters. Dr. Doback is smitten with him. Jenkins, so beloved in the indie sleeper ""The Visitor,"" captures the swoon of a father glad to have found a functional son. In the spirit of ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend,"" Dale and Brennan become fast allies. Other glues that bond them: a porn collection; a treehouse; Marion Zimmer Bradley's"
218,MBC_Doc8_Step_Brothers,MBC_Doc8_Step_Brothers,MBC,Comedy,Negative,Step_Brothers,"Playing like an overlong DVD version of one of his earlier, funnier, PG-13 films, the R-rated Step Brothers finds Will Ferrell diving into raunchier, coarser terrain, resulting in a movie that feels helplessly in thrall to its own foul language and sex jokes. Sporadically hilarious but as dim-witted and juvenile as its knuckle-headed title characters, Step Brothers seems to indicate that Ferrell and writer-director Adam McKay's partnership has lost some of its charm. This Columbia Pictures offering, which opens in the US on July 25, has been smartly positioned between the June comedies Get Smart and You Don't Mess With The Zohan and August laughers The Pineapple Express and Tropic Thunder. Step Brothers marks the third time Will Ferrell and McKay have launched a summer comedy, the other two being solid hits: 2004's Anchorman ($85m domestically) and 2006's Talladega Nights ($148m). And Ferrell had been on a hot streak playing clueless, overgrown adolescents - until February's Semi-Pro, which was a major disappointment at $33.5m. So an interesting question underlying Step Brothers' release is whether that basketball spoof was an aberration or a sign of audience fatigue after a series of familiar roles. One also has to wonder if Step Brothers' R rating will cut significantly into Ferrell's teenage audience. Whatever the case, Ferrell has a poor track record overseas, with his comedies usually bringing in more than 80% of their revenues in the States. It's difficult to imagine Step Brothers reversing that trend when the film starts rolling through international markets in August and September, but regardless, Ferrell should continue to score on ancillary. Brennan (Ferrell) and Dale (John C. Reilly) are both 40, single, hopelessly immature and living at home when their single parents fall in love and get married, bringing the two men together under one roof. While these stepbrothers initially resent one another, they soon form a bond based on their shared childishness. But when their father (Richard Jenkins) demands that they grow up, find a job and move out, Brennan and Dale are thrown into the chaos of the adult world. Step Brothers is unquestionably Ferrell and McKay's most professional-looking film together, ditching their previous comedies' rough-and-tumble edginess for a more conventional feel. But as if to compensate for this professional veneer, Step Brothers is almost unremittingly vulgar and crude, basing much of its humour on mentions (and one appearance) of male genitalia and a cast-wide volleying back and forth of a certain colourful four-letter word. Although the film doesn't drag like Ferrell and McKay's previous outings, with their occasionally lumpy, improv-heavy scenes, Step Brothers' greatest liability is that, unlike those films, it doesn't have an inherently funny concept at its centre. Ostensibly a satire on family and modern man's fears of growing up, neither the characters nor the situation is clever enough to exploit that premise. The movie means to poke fun at the immaturity of its two characters, but the incessantly infantile comedy quickly feels like a concession to the baseness of its intended"

""Step Brothers,"" the newest collaboration between Ferrell and writer-director Adam McKay, produced by Judd Apatow, takes this trend to its logical next step: screaming infantilism. The title characters are Brennan Huff (Ferrell) and Dale Doback (John C. Reilly). Though Brennan is 39 and the unemployed Dale is 40, both still live at home, Brennan with his mom (Mary Steenburgen) and Dale with his doctor dad (Richard Jenkins). When the two parents fall in love and wed, these two spoiled, overgrown infants are thrown together in the same household, and worse, forced to share a room. It's hate at first sight. ""Don't ever touch my drum set!"" wails the angry, threatened Dale, the more aggressive of the two. Brennan, a big wounded teddy bear of a man, does more than touch them. This being an anatomically revealing Apatow production, he proceeds to desecrate them with his family jewels. With many of the ""jokes"" in ""Step Brothers""both guys, improbably, are sleepwalkers, who proceed to trash the house in their somnolent nighttime forays into the kitchenyou may find yourself wincing, rather than laughing, at the overgrown boys' tantrums, which threaten to destroy their parents marriage, not to mention the audience's patience with these two pathologically selfish brats. That ""Step Brothers"" ultimately proves funnier, and more tolerable, than this premise suggests is largely a credit to the gifted and committed cast, who manage to find little air bubbles of subtlety and pathos amidst the broad rumpus room humor. Even when the situations feel rickety and contrived, the four principals find just enough emotional realism to keep the farce from going completely off track. And just when Dale and Brennan's infantile bickering is about to wear out its noisy welcome, Brennan's sleek, successful, intolerably smug brother Derek (Adam Scott) arrives on the scene, and the two mortal enemies bond in their mutual loathing of this snooty entrepreneur. They become allies, though this is far from the end of story, for their friendship proves almost equally destructive. Still, as amusing as ""Step Brothers"" can be, it seems a regression in more ways than one: after McKay's ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,"" a high point along with ""Elf"" in the Ferrell comedy canon, one hoped for more than this overextended ""Saturday Night Live""-style sketch. Though McKay and his castwhich includes the fearless Kathryn Hahn as the despicable Derek's randy, frustrated wife, whose ferocious come-ons to the dumbstruck Dale take lust to hilariously new levelsmake the most of the material, ""Step Brothers"" is constrained by its one-joke concept. The movie, which begins by making fun of its hapless heroes' infantilism, ends by sentimentally celebrating it, as if the only alternative to being a perpetual 13-year-old was dull, soul-squelching, conformist adulthood. This feels less like satire than pandering. I don't want to sound like a"
220,MBC_Doc10_Step_Brothers,MBC_Doc10_Step_Brothers,MBC,Comedy,Negative,Step_Brothers,"When did comedies get so mean? ""Step Brothers"" has a premise that might have produced a good time at the movies, but when I left, I felt a little unclean. The plot: Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly play Brennan and Dale, two never-employed 40-ish sons who still live at home, eating melted cheese nachos and watching TV. When their parents (Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins) get married, they become step-brothers and have to share the same room. This causes them to inflict agonizing pain upon each other and use language that would seem excessive in the men's room of a truck stop. Is this funny? Anything can be funny. Let me provide an example. I am thinking of a particular anatomical act. It is described in explicit detail in two 2008 movies, ""Step Brothers"" and the forthcoming ""Tropic Thunder."" In ""Step Brothers,"" it sounds dirty and disgusting. In ""Tropic Thunder,"" described by Jack Black while he is tied to a tree and undergoing heroin withdrawal, it's funny. Same act, similar descriptions. What's the difference? It involves the mechanism of comedy, I think. The Jack Black character is desperately motivated. He will offer to do anything to be released. In ""Step Brothers,"" the language is simply showing off by talking dirty. It serves no comic function, and just sort of sits there in the air, making me cringe. I know, I know, four-letter language is the currency of a movie like this, and many of the other films Judd Apatow produces. I would be lying if I said I was shocked. I would also be lying if I said I had no taste, or judgment of comic strategy. I'm sure I've seen movies with more extreme language than ""Step Brothers,"" but here it seems to serve no purpose other than simply to exist. In its own tiny way, it lowers the civility of our civilization. Now what about the violence? These two adult children do horrible things to each other. The movie must be particularly proud of one scene, because they show part of it in the trailer. Dale thinks he has killed Brennan by slamming him with the cymbal of his drum set. He rolls him in a rug and prepares to bury him in the lawn. Brennan comes to, bangs Dale with the shovel and starts to bury him alive. I dunno. Maybe it sounds funny when you read it. Coming at the end of a series of similar cruelties, it was one living burial too many. There is also an attempted drowning. And ... never mind. Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins, two gifted actors, do what they can. They despair of their grown-up, unemployed brats. They lay down the law. They realize their sons are destroying their marriage. But they exist in another dimension than Brennan and Dale  almost in another movie.

Is this movie awesome? Yes. Have I seen it more than 20 times before? Why, yes I have indeed. If you haven't seen this movie yet, THIS WILL BE a great time to download it and see it. I not only recommend it with the whole of my heart, I demand it! I demand that you see this movie! You owe it to yourself to see this movie, you really and truly do. Ok, let us get to it. Lets start with the basics. Like music, environment, storyline, acting, the shooting of the movie, directing, etcetera. I like music, no, that is a gross understatement! I love music! I could not imagine a world without music or what that would be like, but I am sure that it would not be a world I would want to live in. I find music along with sound and sound effects and other effects of course, I find it gives the movie life, If you know what I mean. It gives the movie a certain boost of some kind. It really brings it to life. The music in this brilliancy of a movie was great. It fit the scenes and the story. It brought the moods out in the light like it is supposed to, so you can tell what kind of situation it is. Is it a sad one? Is it a serious one? Is it a funny one? What is it? The music gives you the answers to that, with some help from the effects and stuff of course. Allrighty then, let us take on the story or the storyline of the movie ""Taxi"". Let me just start by saying Luc Besson is a genius for thinking of this. It gave me a whole new perspective of French writers and directors. It opened my eyes to the whole wide world. Before, I was narrow-minded, but now I can see it all for what it really is. There is something positive and negative with everything. Every nation has its heroes and brilliant minds. Every genre of music has its kings and queens, but also tone-deaf cadavers. Basically everything and everyone has both good and bad sides, something or someone has a little more good than bad and vice-versa, but I am rambling. What I am trying to say is that; this storyline is a unbelievably brilliant one. As simple as that. As I might have forgotten to mention, Queen Latifah plays the main character in this movie.

222,MZZ_Doc2_TAXI,MZZ_Doc2_TAXI,MZZ,Action,Positive,TAXI,"After five years of waiting, Belle Williams (Queen Latifah) is finally getting her hack license, and New York City had better watch out, because she makes the typical New York cabbie look like a driver's ed poster child. At the same time, Washburn (Jimmy Fallon), a bumbling New York City policeman, has just had his license taken away after totaling his third police car. When Washburn hears of a nearby bank robbery over his radio while walking a beat, he commandeers Belle's cab, and a new, extremely reckless partnership is born. Surely, something bizarre is going on with the mainstream public opinion about this film as of this writing. While I can understand someone not thinking that Taxi is the best thing since sliced bread, it's unconscionable to give this film a 1 or 2. Anyone rating this film so low can't possibly be looking at the ""whole picture"", so to speak, or they must be watching with a ridiculous set of preconceptions/expectations. When you rate a film, you have to consider the whole package, as an artwork. There's a lot more to it than whether you like the story or not, whether you thought it was funny or not, or whether you think it's realistic or not. For example, the cinematography in Taxi is incredible. Just the opening sequence alone, featuring ""Belle"" on a high speed, stunt-filled messenger bike ride through New York City makes the film worth a few points. The camera work and staging are stunning. There are all kinds of unique, subtle touches in the scene, like the shot of traffic where only the cabs are in color at first. It seems that a lot of people don't like the film just because it's a remake of Gerard Pires' 1998 French film of the same name, or just because it's a Hollywood film, or just because they've changed the gender or dispositions of the characters, or because they're misunderstanding the idea of comedy and expecting realism. None of those facts make this an inherently bad film. The idea is that you're rating/reviewing a film, as an artwork, not making a political statement or rating cultural facts that have nothing to do with what's on the screen. I disagree that fiction is necessarily making claims about how the actual world happens to be. Especially comedy cannot be just realistic and still be funny. To be comedy, something has to be absurd, exaggerated, made ironic, and so on. In general, I'm not looking for realism in films, even though Taxi has some very interesting and funny jabs at the real New York City. There are people like Belle and Washburn here, even if less comically exaggerated. There are cabbies who drive like Belle--I had the misfortune of riding home from the Newark airport with one who was going 100 mph (160 kph) while weaving in and out of traffic, often straddling two lanes. I've seen a number of people use Washburn's method of parallel parking (that's one of"

Washburn tries to get back on the case, and Belle tries to get back her cab. TAXI is surprisingly funny and effective. Certain parts are silly, but the movie is fast-paced and doesn't take itself too seriously. The actors' easygoing chemistry makes for a few good laughs, and the chase scenes lend variety. Families will be disturbed to see the high foul language count, however. This should have been cut down considerably and even eliminated. On the good side, the movie clearly defines moral lines. The bank robbers are clearly the bad guys, and they are caught in the end. Although Fallon's police detective is a goofball, he's good-natured and cares about his job. Overall, TAXI is a fun movie that limits its audience with too much foul language, jokes about drinking and brief sexual innuendo.

224,MZZ_Doc4_TAXI,MZZ_Doc4_TAXI,MZZ,Action,Positive,TAXI,"First off, I already know that a lot of people didn't like this movie much, and I haven't looked up why yet. I'll admit that Taxi is not that flat-out hilarious nor is it anything groundbreakingly original, but it combines elements that audiences go for and presents them in a package that I thought was pretty good entertainment. The film grabs your attention from the start with an amazing stunt scene: a motorcycle tearing through the streets, alleyways, subway stations, sidewalks of New York in a race against the clock to get from Brooklyn to somewhere in Manhattan and back. The opening credits end with the driver making it to the finish line, taking off her helmet, and surprise it's a woman...Queen Latifah. Her character is apparently, not just any pizza delivery girl/cab driver but the fastest one around. A driver hops into her car at one point early in the movie offering to give her 100 dollars if he'll get her from JFK from midtown Manhattan in 15 minutes. With her trademark large-and-in-charge cockiness, she tells him how she normally doesn't stop for white guys but with him she'll make an exception (the guy's pretty rude to her so you don't really feel bad for him, and also don't get the wrong impression, this isn't a movie about a black person making fun of white people for 2 hours aka Chris Tucker in Rush Hour), and off she goes once again breaking traffic laws left and right, driving so fast that she outruns a couple policemen trying to get her for speeding. With her driving abilities, she naturally becomes a fitting compliment to Jimmy Fallon's detective Washburn, a cop who's achilles heel is he can't drive a car. When he's dispatched to attempt to stop a bank robbery, he has to call a cab to get to the scene, and that's how the two, through comically unusual circumstances, end up having to team up together until the case is solved and she can get her car back. Like Latifah, Fallon's character doesn't drift too far off from the comic we've come to know on SNL, and part of the joy of watching the film is the the joy this overgrown child has in picking up guns and playing cop. I don't know about anyone else, but I really thought Latifah and Fallon had a great odd-couple chemistry or should I say lack thereof. You'll have trouble finding two people at such opposite ends of the spectrum from each other. The movie wisely skirts around a road to a love/hate romance, giving Latifah's character a boyfriend who plays a minor role in the picture, and Fallon a crush on his boss (Spin City's Jennifer Esposito), and the funny moments when Esposito shoots down Fallon makes me think the movie is more self-conscious of itself than it lets on. The movie really does have a lot to it, in my opinion, if you don't go in expecting instantaneous laughs, throwing in"

Hot off the heels of a critical lambasting from seemingly everybody comes Tim Story's Taxi, the latest Stateside re-hashing of a great foreign movie. The Americanised version of the Luc Besson scripted Euro-hit of the same name is, to be brutally honest, a huge slice of big, dumb, irresponsible junk. And yet, flying in the face of popular opinion, I have to admit that it is all the more enjoyable because of it. Yeah, really. I know, I know. I didn't expect to like this much either, and I suppose that your interest in it can only depend on your tolerance level for Saturday Night Live regular Jimmy Fallon's brand of inane, geeky humour. But, if you switch off your pre-conceptions about the stereotypical, mismatched buddy-buddy set-up that we've all seen a million times before, and the inevitable squirm-inducing sass of hip-hop star Queen Latifah as a speed-freak taxi driver and accept the movie's all-round hokey-ness, then you're in for a relatively painless dose of free-wheeling fun. Fallon's inept cop, Andy Washburn, simply cannot drive. Latifah's Belle is the craziest cabbie in New York, tooling around in a souped-up vehicle that has more gimmicky gadgets than a fleet of Bond cars. Thrown together by chance they end up being the only ones that can catch a gang of supermodel uber-babes that are hitting banks with a vengeance and then high-tailing it in their own turbo-charged BMW. Story-wise, that's your lot. There may be a vague subplot of the merest variety about Belle and her long-suffering boyfriend trying to get it on, but Taxi really just wants to burn rubber and hustle its comedy duo from one zany set-piece to the next. Washburn is the typical joke cop - a clueless, excitable parody that Fallon only barely manages to keep the right side of irritating. His lack of driving skills are legendary on the Force and, after a lame undercover operation at the start of the movie fails spectacularly due to his stupidity behind the wheel, he is busted back down to walking the beat. However, this guy is still a disaster just looking for somewhere to happen. Take a gander at the ludicrous car pile-up that he causes with a simple cry of ""Freeze ... police officer!"" But we are not talking a bumbling Inspector Clouseau here. Fallon is new generation, so we are treated to a veritable torrent of caricature, voice-gags and pop-culture riffs on everything from street-cool to Gollum's precious, as well as the standard slapstick. Now, I've not seen this guy in anything else but it is quite clear that he is NOT the next big thing, despite this movie's almost die-hard intentions to showcase his particular talents. Indeed, director Story seems overly content to allow Fallon as much improvisational antics as he can and, as a result, many one-joke scenes are permitted to carry on for far too"

Honestly, this film stole some laughs from me, but not many, I mean: it was really stupid and nonsense most of the time. I couldn't think of anyone believing that if a person is funny doing one thing, this makes that person funny in doing anything. Yes, as many could say, Jimmy Fallon spreads talent all around when he steps on the ""SNL"" set. But when he steps on a movie set, I have to tell him: ""That's different buddy, you're not doing the same thing you do always"" What a mistake they made in telling this guy to act as he always does. Movies are another thing, and for a television actor, a very important chance. You're ruining it, Jimmy! It was awful to hear this guy talking and see him making faces. He had the stupid lines (""My precious"") and the embarrassing moments. I mean, the movie was embarrassing in these moments, but he made it more embarrassing. Good luck with your next project, Jim, although I'm not expecting one. The rest of the cast was pretty solid, for what they needed to do. Queen Latifah continues to grow (and I'm really sorry if you don't agree) as a charming leading lady (in this case playing the taxi driver Belle) becoming the only worthy thing to watch in the movies she's in. I mean, last year I went to see ""Bringing down the house""; I fell asleep! She woke me up, or a friend of mine, I think. So I should just recognize Latifah's talent and hope she continues to grow. The experienced Ann-Margret has the biggest, if not the only laughs in the movie, drinking without stopping for a second, and living next to his son Washburn (Jimmy Fallon). This made me thought if Fallon lives with his mother too. Henry Simmons, still a newcomer, gave the best of his character, which wasn't much. Actually, nothing could be much at all, because the storyline was so repetitive and the script was so lame. They just couldn't get tired of chasing scenes, could they? The film is not a shame when it comes to direction; but I just can't understand why Tim Story, after doing a respectable comedy like ""Barbershop"", got into this. There was a lot of movement in the camera, not that bad. The Statue of Liberty shot and Times Square weren't forgotten, of course. If I don't say much about the story, it's not because I want you to find out, but because it would be useless (you'll probably get what I mean, later). But then after all, we end up wanting a little bit more from this piece that doesn't"
227,MZZ_Doc7_TAXI,MZZ_Doc7_TAXI,MZZ,Action,Negative,TAXI,"Importing a successful idea from a great producer like Besson (The 5th Element, anyone?) and transform it in such a disaster is something quite rare. In fact, being a faithful fan of the original great 3 movies, I'm personally insulted. Okay, let's compare: Starting with the actors, well, the funny skinny cynical driver, Daniel, has been replaced by... the irritating, way too confident Queen Latifat... ?Queen Latifat? Seriously?! She hasn't the right attitude to play this role, although the person in charge of the cast selection is more to blame than the girl herself! Sure, I don't like her at all (like every man), but she's still an okay actress. As far as it's not supposed to be serious, she manages to stay natural, even thru these -very- stupid lyrics. Talking about stupidity, Jimmy Fallon took the place of the rookie cop, originally called Emilien, now named Washburn. In fact, he seems to try to be the next Jim Carrey, playing the naive, ""unvolontary clownesque"" kinda guy. Goofiness has its limits, at least in terms of credibility, and Fallon has none. Just watching him hitting cars like a blind cerebrally paralyzed deficient, just because we need to know that he's bad at driving, will make you sick and disgusted about mankind... Fallon is now on my top-5 of the worst performance ever (Steve West being the #1 playing ""The incredible melting man""), really. He's not just pathetic, I dunno, I can't find the word... but I'll have to censure myself. This remake is in fact quite different from its counterpart, and not for the best: Several characters changed of sex, which just corrupted the way the movie should sound and was originally intended, while some simply got deleted. Overall, these new characters were poorly acted, average at best. Furtermore, the speedy, tortuous, sunny and marvelous locations of the original movie have been replaced by the gray and boring vicinities of New-York city. The truly sporty and lovely roaring Peugeot 406 of the original movies is now a heavy and huge Crown Victoria, pathetically disguised with a hood intake, skirts, mags and spoiler, and, oh joy! it's yellow! It seems they just forgot that the taxi was the core of the concept, feeling now like an accessory. And, seriously, USA rule 3 major motor companies, Ford, Dodge and GM... Ain't there hotter cars than this standard taxi juggernaut?! How about story? The trilogy was humor and action centered, so the story was a pretext to speed excess, laugh, and gun fire. Then, if you take the USA version, just dilute everything down 10 times and you'll almost get it. The original sarcastic atmosphere and well timed jokes left place to some of the most anorexic, silly and uninspired humor you've seen since a long time. I'm glad I haven't paid to see it, but my poor sister did, what was she thinking? Only ""Are we there yet?"" come close to to that level of crappiness... and guess what? She rented it"

Meanwhile cycle courier Belle has finally gotten her taxi license and is preparing her souped up vehicle for the New York City streets. When a bank robbery in progress is called in, Washburn commandeers Belle's cab and gets involved in a high-speed chase with a group of Brazilian supermodels in a red BMW. Thrown off the case by the FBI, Washburn wants to catch the gang to get his job back, while Belle agrees to help so that she can get her taxi out of lockup. I quite liked the original for what it was so I decided to give this film a try to see if it could manage to be fun. I'll be honest and say that the trailer attracted me because it had car chases, a bit of a laugh and some faux-lesbian teasing  there, gone are my 'art-house' credentials! I hoped that these elements could be kept fun and that the film could have a spark to it in some area that would raise it above the genre and actually make it fun to watch. Sadly I was wrong and my worries about the effort put into this film were realized in the first few minutes of the film where a skinny person on a bike is revealed to be Belle  even though their body shapes could not be more different! With this lack of attention to detail I did not have high hopes but I figured I was being picky and tried to get past it. However from here on in everything is exactly as you would expect  lacking imagination and effort in almost every regard. The plot is nonsense but to pick on that is to be too demanding because none of us expected anything too cohesive or logical but suffice to say that attempts to build stories around the characters are all flat and uninteresting. However what I did need from the film was action, excitement, comedy and spark. The action is OK but nothing special  the use of CGI cars to make impossible stunts really takes away from the impact of the action, while the limitations of the busy streets means that the car chases are very tightly cut and never feel real and impressive. This reduces how excited the audience can feel and me and the other 15 people in the cinema sat rather impassive for most of the action scenes. With this OK, then the comedy needed to match it to produce an OK film, but it didn't. Not at all. The comedy is partly based on that wonderful comic device  that black people are cool and sassy while white people are geeky and uptight. Oh, how I never tire of seeing racial stereotypes enforced in the name of comedy. With this old chestnut wheeled out again, the rest"
229,MZZ_Doc9_TAXI,MZZ_Doc9_TAXI,MZZ,Action,Negative,TAXI,"I'm actually old enough that when I hear the word 'Taxi' as a title I think first of the melancholy Harry Chapin song, a wonderful piece of music; maybe with a little reflection, I conjure up the seventies sitcom of the same name. Perhaps the makers of this new film were hoping for some of that association to rub off on people and lure them in, because if a movie is titled what it's really about, this one should have been called 'Chasing four hot chicks who can't speak English.' The plot of Taxi follows Detective Washburn (Jimmy Fallon, making his debut as a movie lead) and bike-messenger-turned-cab-driver Belle (Queen Latifah) as they inadvertently get tangled up with one another and have to figure out who is ripping off a series of Manhattan banks and try to catch them. Rounding out the cast (no pun intended) are Jennifer Esposito (you might remember her from Spin City) as Washburn's lieutenant, Marta, and supermodel Gisele Bundchen as the head hot chick. I knew I was in trouble when I saw 'based on a script by Luc Besson,' because, while I like some of Besson's material, he hasn't done a good movie since 'Fifth Element' and that was a while ago now. I haven't seen his version of this movie, but I'm betting it's nearly as maladroit as this one. Much of the problem stems from the casting. Fallon, while a funny performer, is just out of place as a dorky, inept bumbler; it's as if he's trying to channel Inspector Clouseau half the time. Having him be a little green is one thing; but he's a walking mess, unable to do anything right, and it gets irritating quickly. Latifah, by contrast, is comfortable in her role, and she's a lot more enjoyable, but it's really hard to accept her as a bike messenger, especially after the lengthy stunt/title sequence they begin the movie with (one of the funniest gags in the movie, unintentionally of course, is watching a bike messenger do all this zany stuff and then having him pull off his helmet at the end of the sequence only to reveal Latifah. Come on, we're just not that naive). Esposito isn't too bad, but she's only given the standard 'angry cop lieutenant' cliche to work with, and even she can't make it work (and she seems a tad young to be a lieutenant, but that's another story). Only two people are really right for their roles: Bundchen and Ann Margaret, who plays Fallon's lush of a mother. Her scenes are kept short and punchy, and she's really effective and funny. Bundchen doesn't have to do much but look good in incredibly brief outfits, sort of what she does for a living anyway, but she has screen presence and in her limited role she works well enough (and has inhumanly long legs, but that's beside the point). She has just enough sass to pull off the role. Taxi has a few honest"

This is, of course, not possible to do, and the sequence ends with that ancient cliche in which the rider whips off a helmet and  why, it's Queen Latifah! It's her last day on the job. She has finally qualified for her taxi license, and before long we see the customized Yellow Cab she's been working on for three years. Besides the titanium supercharger given by her fellow bike messengers as a farewell present (uh-huh), the car has more gimmicks than a James Bond special; a custom job like this couldn't be touched at under $500,000, which, of course, all bike messengers keep under the bed. Her dream, she says, is to be a NASCAR driver. In her Yellow Cab? Then we meet a cop named Washburn (Jimmy Fallon), who is spectacularly incompetent, blows drug busts, causes traffic accidents and has, not his badge, but his driver's license confiscated by his chief, Lt. Marta Robbins (Jennifer Esposito), who used to be his squeeze. But no more. When he hears about a bank robbery, he commandeers Queen Latifah's cab, and soon she is racing at speeds well over 100 mph down Manhattan streets in pursuit of the robbers, who are, I kid you not, four supermodels who speak Portuguese. Luckily, Queen Latifah speaks Portuguese, too, because, I dunno, she used to be the delivery girl for a Portuguese takeout joint. Oh, this is a bad movie. Why, oh why, was the lovely Ann-Margret taken out of retirement to play Fallon's mother, an alcoholic with a blender full of margaritas? Who among the writers (Luc Besson, Ben Garant, Thomas Lennon and Jim Kouf) thought it would be funny to give Latifah and the cop laughing gas so they could talk funny? What's with Latifah's fiance Jesse (Henry Simmons), who looks like a GQ cover boy and spends long hours in fancy restaurants waiting for Queen Latifah, who is late because she is chasing robbers, etc.? Is there supposed to be subtle chemistry between Latifah and the cop? It's so subtle, we can't tell. (He's afraid to drive because he had a traumatic driving lesson, so she coaches him to sing while he's driving, and he turns into a stunt driver and a pretty fair singer. Uh-huh.) All these questions pale before the endless, tedious chase scenes, in which cars do things that cars cannot do, so we lose all interest. If we were cartoons, our eyes would turn into X-marks. What is the point of showing a car doing 150 mph through midtown Manhattan? Why is it funny that the cop causes a massive pileup, with the cars in back leapfrogging onto the top"
231,NAF_Doc1_Barbie,NAF_Doc1_Barbie,NAF,Comedy,Negative,Barbie,"Barbie arrives, on an effervescing carpet of halogen pink, bearing handbags, earrings and helium giggles. She is everywhere: on our hoardings, in our papers; she is replicating, like a searing neon virus, across the internet. Barbie is already the movie of the summer whether you like it or not; it's funny, frothy, a great night out, five stars, even ""the culmination of all cinematic history""  pick your instant internet review. This isn't because it's art, of course, but a vast and impressive marketing operation, bigger even than The Lego Movie (a clear inspiration). And you can't help feeling totally and utterly flattened and killed by it. Right from the opening moments it's clear that Mattel simply gave Greta Gerwig, one of Hollywood's most thoughtful, interesting directors, 110 million  three times her next biggest budget as a director  and said, in the typical style of now, ""You can have whatever you want."" And she's gone absolutely mad in the toy shop: famous faces have been flown in by the planeload. Rob Brydon is there, for 20 seconds, as Sugar Daddy Ken (a real doll invented for the company's 50th anniversary in 2009). Dua Lipa, Marisa Abela, Michael Cera  Helen Mirren is just tossed away on just three or four lines of voiceover. Will Ferrell is playing the same role he's played since The Lego Movie: the evil, real-world chief executive of Mattel. It makes for a stunningly disjointed cast: influencers are parachuted in just so the box can be ticked, including, of course, a trans Barbie. Margot Robbie, a glassy, slightly psychotic actress, is the show's main attraction: ""stereotypical Barbie"", a breathtakingly beautiful, sugar-spun confection. She lives in a Dreamland house where she takes showers without any water and slides directly into a pink Cadillac outside her house. It's a set designer's dream: plastic waters lap the pink shores. If there are any Oscars to be had, and I doubt there are for this gigantic, hot, roiling slop of a film, it'll be for costume, set, hair and make-up. As for the plot, well, it's back-of-the-napkin stuff. Barbie notices changes to her body. She's got cellulite, and her normally perfectly pointed feet have flattened. In a series of rather convoluted jumps we are told she must travel to the real(ish) world to discover the little girl who's doing these things to her. And when she gets there, she's horrified to discover that the real world is dominated by men. Everything is ""reversed"", she squeals. Ken, by contrast, loves it. I must say, I found the politics of this film utterly incoherent. It's a 12A, but I wouldn't let my six-year-old daughter near it. It's filled with adult concepts, jokes and themes: the idea that men are stupid, go to the gym, run everything and don't care about women, while women are sensible, striving but ultimately conflicted victims. In trying to be comically ahead of the sexism curve, it's ended up feeling sexist itself. For example, during one"
232,NAF_Doc2_Barbie,NAF_Doc2_Barbie,NAF,Comedy,Negative,Barbie,"BOTTOM LINE An uneven blend of candy-colored fantasy and cultural critique. Two movies centering on life-changing creations arrive on screens this week: ""Oppenheimer,"" Christopher Nolan's biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, and ""Barbie,"" Greta Gerwig's comedy about the curvy blonde doll. The former wrestles with morality and the threat of nuclear apocalypse  but who would have guessed that the doll would be the more complicated topic? ""Barbie"" may look like a pink-and-pastel fantasia, but it's also an attempt to parse the significance of the most iconic and controversial toy in the history of modern childhood. Though she began her full-figured existence in 1959 as an alternative to the infant dolls that trained girls to be mommies, Barbie today is more often blasted as an anti-feminist, shamed for her impossible beauty and blamed for everything from eating disorders to internalized racism. Yet she still sells by the millions. Tackling all of this would be a challenge for any movie, let alone one produced by Barbie's owner, Mattel, Inc. Gerwig tries, packing ""Barbie"" with campy humor, musical numbers and whimsical stage sets. There's also enough cultural critique to fill a graduate school seminar. The result is one ambitious but highly uneven film. Gerwig and co-writer/partner Noah Baumbach have dreamed up a clever conceit: Barbie (Margot Robbie, born for the role) lives in an artificial world where women rule. Living under a female president (Issa Rae) and an all-female Supreme Court, guys like Ken (Ryan Gosling, not born for the role but all the funnier for it) are mere decorations who sit around and idolize the women. (All Barbies are Barbie, by the way, just as all Kens are Ken; this makes for amusing end credits.) ""Thanks to Barbie,"" says our deadpan narrator, Helen Mirren, ""all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved."" Ah, but when Barbie's tippy-toe feet suddenly go flat, she must venture into the real world to find out why. Here, things are reversed: Barbie experiences her first sexual assault (a construction worker slaps her butt) while Ken, tagging along, discovers the joys of patriarchy. Lording it over a newly diminished and disempowered Barbie, Ken delivers what may be the film's most trenchant lines: ""How's that feel? It is not fun, is it?"" Disappointingly, ""Barbie"" cribs heavily from ""The Lego Movie,"" casting its hero as a plaything who meets her owners  Ariana Greenblatt as a furiously woke teenager and America Ferrera as her Barbie-loving mom  and inserting Will Ferrell as the blustering head of Mattel (which must have decided that a little mockery was worth the product placement). Meanwhile, there's so much talk about Barbie's relationship to feminism that Barbie herself never quite emerges as a flesh-and-blood character. That may be the movie's fatal flaw. Barbie cannot and must not be clearly defined; that would only limit her possibilities and put her back in a box. In the end, Barbie remains what she was at the start: a symbol, open to virtually any"
233,NAF_Doc3_Barbie,NAF_Doc3_Barbie,NAF,Comedy,Negative,Barbie,"The beginning of Greta Gerwig's career was niche. Her first film as an actor and co-writer, Joe Swanberg's largely improvised ""mumblecore"" feature Hannah Takes the Stairs (2007), opens with Gerwig sitting with only a bath towel on her lap while a boyfriend and she laugh and pick lint from their skin. It's a hot Chicago summer, she's slacking at her pointless job, and she wants to be in love. Later they kiss on the sand wearing snorkeling goggles. After they break up, she cry-shouts a soliloquy at her friend in the bathtub, again in goggles and swimsuits: ""I get really frustrated because I love things so much and I feel like what I do is so trite and small."" She talks sweetly to her second boyfriend, a dorky co-worker (Andrew Bujalski), through a rainbow-slinky telephone. She cries and asks her third boyfriend, ""Do you ever think there's something manic about having crushes?"" There are stains on Bujalski's underpants. She sifts through her third boyfriend's many antidepressants as they talk about their disappointments. They play the trumpet twice. In the last scene, they play it naked in the tub. Swanberg, Bujalski and other mumblecore peers found moderate levels of success, but only Greta Gerwig soared. Her career reached a new stage with her Noah Baumbach collaborations, first as her director in Greenberg (2010) and soon as her co-writer and husband. He directed her starring role in Frances Ha (2012), an iconic late-hipster film about an aimless 27-year-old dancer, flailing around New York after her best friend moves out to live with her rich boyfriend. She starred in a 2015 film involving a pickle entrepreneur, a ""ficto-critical anthropologist"", and sperm donation among friends (Rebecca Miller's Maggie's Plan). But soon, she was directing. Her first two films, Lady Bird and Little Women, were both nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture; together, they racked up 11 nominations. The first netted a profit of $69m; the latter, around $180m. Besides directing indie films and releasing them online, Swanberg now runs a VHS store inside a pizza shop. Lady Bird, while far more polished than the films of her mumblecore period, was a very personal, semi-autobiographical film about an ambitious but middle-class Sacramento high schooler interested in theatre and escaping to the East Coast; a character's band is called L'enfance nue, after Maurice Pialat's devastating 1968 film about a desperately unhappy child in foster care. Little Women was an adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's 1868 novel of the same name; its Oscar win, Gerwig's only to date, was for Best Costume Design. Gerwig's third feature is another departure in all respects, save an interest in female existence. Gerwig is, obviously, no longer mumblecore; she is no longer even an arthouse filmmaker, or even, perhaps, an especially artistic one. As recently reported by the New Yorker, the genesis of the Barbie movie was not so much a private inspiration as the bankruptcy of Toys R Us in 2017. Mattel largely sold its Barbie dolls through"

The film's director, Greta Gerwig, has compared Barbieland to a prelapsarian Paradise, a place ""with no death, no ageing, no decay, no pain, no shame"". Barbieland is not a utopia, it's a version of the United States. There's a Barbie President (Issa Rae), and a Barbie-friendly Constitution. The full bench of the Supreme Court is a set of Barbies. Visually, Barbieland is a throwback to the era of Technicolor musicals. It boasts painted backdrops and meticulous set and costume design  if Barbie doesn't win the Oscar for costume design next year, I'll eat my hat (Barbie-sized). But Gerwig is constrained by the fact that Barbie's world was only ever an idealised miniature of mid-20th-century America. Decades later and this is the nearest to an Eden that can be conceived by a Hollywood director: a very pink suburbia, ruled by the competent. For the sake of plot, some shadows must intrude. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie), to give her full name, is troubled by thoughts of mortality. Her previously arched feet, which fit perfectly into her high-heeled shoes, have collapsed, causing consternation among both the Barbies and the Kens. She seeks counsel from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon, having a great time), who lays out the state of things. On the other side of Barbieland, in the real world, are humans who are playing with their Barbies. A Barbie who is played with ""too hard"" by her human, like Weird Barbie with her scribbled-on face and punk hair, starts to develop symptoms here in Barbieland. Go forth then, Barbie, and find who is hurting you. Set your world  and the human world  to rights. But first, a word on the Kens. Ah, the Kens. There are many, many Kens, including Ken number one, Stereotypical Barbie's stereotypical sidekick, played by Ryan Gosling in full himbo mode. Ken is blond, waxed and gormless; his job title is ""Beach"". He spends his Ken days diving into fake waves and posing on fake sand. Ken is a little frustrated by the fact that every night at Barbie's Dreamhouse is a girls' night in, with no place for him. Still, he lives (as much as a doll can live) for Barbie. Barbie is good: the whole point of Barbie is that she is good. She's every Good Witch and Sugar Plum Fairy melted down and poured out again into a perfect mould. But Ken is ridiculous, and the actors shine accordingly.

The central Barbie, played by Margot Robbie in a role that was seemingly waiting for her, is ""Stereotypical Barbie""the sparkly but brainless basic version who exists mainly to look pretty. When this Barbie starts experiencing morbid thoughts as though infected by human doubts, the movie turns into a reverse ""Wizard of Oz."" She journeys to Mattel headquarters in contemporary Los Angeles, joined by her uninvited, little-considered boyfriend, Ken (Ryan Gosling), who is tired of being treated as her accessory, to investigate a tear in the fabric between fantasy and reality. Feminist enlightenment follows, but while Barbie is discovering herself, Ken learns that real society is male-dominated and uses the lesson to turn Barbieland into the Kendoma bro paradise of brewskis and weight lifting.

Ms. Gerwig and Mr. Baumbach are accomplished indie filmmakers (she made ""Lady Bird,"" he ""The Squid and the Whale""; both are wonderful) who make poor choices to flesh out these characters. Try to imagine ""The Super Mario Bros.

This is, first off, because the boundless possibilities of the fantastical both allow for and require a filmmaker's comprehensive creativity. But, crucially, fantasy is also a vision of realitythe subjective truth of filmmakers' inner life, the world as it appears in their mind's eye. The great directors of fantasy are the ones who make explicit the connection between their fantasy worlds and lived reality, as Wes Anderson recently did in ""Asteroid City,"" and as Greta Gerwig has done spectacularly in her new film, ""Barbie."" Unlike Anderson, who has spent his entire career on the far side of the imagination, Gerwig's previous features as solo director, ""Lady Bird"" and ""Little Women""both ardently crafted, both modestly literaldid little to foreshadow the overwhelming outburst of inventive energy that makes ""Barbie"" such a thrilling experience. Though ""Lady Bird,"" Gerwig's breakthrough feature, is a fictionalized story of her own adolescence, her family life, and her home town, ""Barbie""yes, a movie about a doll made under the aegis of its manufacturer, Mattelis the far more personal film. It's a film that's energized throughout by a sense of artistic freedom and uninhibited creative passion greater than what Gerwig has brought to even her previous projects made outside the ostensible constraints of studio filmmaking. The underlying subject of ""Barbie"" is how to play with Barbie dolls and why. Playing with Barbies, after all, is the D.I.Y. version of adaptation, the enactment in private of the kind of free and wild play that Gerwig (who wrote the script with her romantic and creative partner, Noah Baumbach) enacts in the movie. ""Barbie"" is about the intellectual demand and emotional urgency of making preexisting subjects one's own, and it advocates for imaginative infidelity, the radical off-label manipulation of existing intellectual property. Moreover, it presents such acts of reinterpreting familiar subjects, as a crucial form of self-analysis, a way to explore one's own self-image and to confront the prejudices and inequities built into prevailing, top-down interpretations of them. ""Barbie,"" in other words, is a film of the politics of culture and, by extension, of the need for a creative rebellion to reestrange the familiar for the sake of social change. The movie begins with one of the most ingenious parodies I've seen in a while, an origin story of the Barbie doll based on the opening sequence of ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""

This was a period in time when young girls were in desperate need of role models, and Barbie came along as a vehicle to convey the message of independence, which is the theme of Greta Gerwig's film. Written by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, the film begins with Stereotypical Barbie (Robbie) having a perfect day in Barbie Land, her perfect pink town. She gets ready without even putting on clothes and drinks from cups with nothing in them. She doesn't eat or clean because everything is predestined to function. Barbie Land is run on female energy, and they serve in every possible working position  Supreme Court justices, doctors, scientists. Women can be anything they want to be here.

A Barbie beach house party filled with choreographed dancing is halted by Miss Stereotypical questioning if anyone else thinks about death. The next morning, things are way off. Barbie isn't wearing pink, the breakfast burns, milk is expired, and her pointed feet go flat  then it hits her that she's having lingering thoughts of existential dread. To find out what's going on, she has to go to the home of Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) and is told she has to enter the real world to find the girl who owns her version of the doll. There is some mental crossover that's causing Barbie to have feelings she doesn't know how to deal with. Although the mission makes her nervous, she's excited to step into a new environment because thanks to her, women rule the real world too, right? Get ready for a big slap of reality, ma'am. What Baumbach and Gerwig's script does well is give characters an ultra-awareness of their surroundings. Barbie recognizes its own surreal existence: a world where perfect plastic figures wrestle with humanistic imperfections. It acknowledges that change, even when challenging, is necessary and that perfection is an unrealistic and even undesirable goal. Issues of feminism and patriarchy are serious topics, but the writing duo managed to state their values with the right amount of levity and camp so that it doesn't distract from the film's message  which is all about finding yourself and finding balance. Robbie, in the titular role, is as remarkable as ever. Her commitment to her roles is well known, and Barbie is no exception. She imbues her character with a depth and complexity that elevates Barbie beyond the plastic persona associated with the doll. Robbie is backed by an equally talented cast including Gosling  who serves up camp so well  McKinnon, America Ferrera, Michael Cera, Simu Liu, Will Ferrell, Emma Mackey, Issa Rae, Hari Nef, Ncuti Gatwa, Alexandra Shipp and others, all of whom deliver compelling performances.

238,NAF_Doc8_Barbie,NAF_Doc8_Barbie,NAF,Comedy,Positive,Barbie,"""Do you guys ever think about dying?"" Hi Barbie. Nice to see you on screens everywhere embodied to impossible perfection by Margot Robbie. So what's an existential line about deatha topic the Mattel toy company never considered when they introduced the plastic Barbie doll in 1959 doing in a pretty-in-pink fantasia that's built to be the party movie of the summer? Glad you asked. It's part of a plan from Greta Gerwig (""Little Women""), the Oscar nominated director of ""Lady Bird"" who wrote the subversively funny script with her partner Noah Baumbach, to give audiences what Gerwig calls, ""the thing you didn't know you wanted."" So let's jump back a minute. Until Barbie quits a disco dance to ask disturbing questions, her movie rides high on a pink cloud of feminist wish fulfillment in which Barbies come in all shapes, sizes and colors. There's a President Barbie (Issa Rae), an all-Barbie Supreme Court, a Barbie played by trans actress Hari Nef and, well, you get the woke picture. Robbie's so-called ""Stereotypical Barbie"" floats through Barbielandgorgeously imagined by Gerwig and her dazzling design teamconcerned with fashion and party choices. Guys? They're beach accessories, even the Ken doll that the irresistibly hilarious and heartfelt Ryan Gosling brings to such sweet, clueless life. ""I'm just Ken,"" he sings, as if that's enough. Hook-ups don't really apply even when Ken asks to stay over for the night. ""For what?"" asks a wide-eyed Barbie. ""I'm actually not sure,"" says Ken. Robbie and Gosling are a match made in movie heaven. And Gerwig could have sent her ""Barbie"" to box-office glory simply by riding the safe surface of her comic vision. That, of course, goes against everything Gerwig stands for as a filmmaker who lives to probe under the Hollywood veneer. As a producer as well as a star, Robbie chose Gerwig to steer her Barbie ship fully knowing that risk is part of the Gerwig equation. Innocence goes out the window when Weird Barbie (the great Kate McKinnon) tells Robbie's stereotypical version to banish her fears about cellulite, flat feet and mortality by entering the real world. Shot in Los Angelesarguably the most unreal place in Americathe film switches gears into a toxic universe ruled by the patriarchy. It's a revelation for Ken and his fellow dudes, including Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir and Michael Cera, but hell for Barbie. Gerwig's ambition is indisputable, but her goals can also trip her up. She satirizes the greed of Mattel executives, led by a boobish Will Ferrell, who only want to exploit Barbie for fun and profit. But she's doing the same thing since the movie couldn't happen without Mattel financing. Like it or not, everyone is still hawking a toy doll. A terrific America Ferrera as a Mattel executive with a preteen daughter (Ariana Greenblatt) who thinks Barbie is a fascist out to glorify rampant consumerism delivers a rousing speech about women fighting for equality, but the lecture seems less organic than tacked-on and self-congratulatory. Is Barbie"
239,NAF_Doc9_Barbie,NAF_Doc9_Barbie,NAF,Comedy,Positive,Barbie,"For someone who's 11.5 inches tall and weighs under 8 ounces, poor Barbie's had to carry an awfully heavy load over the years on that slender, plastic back of hers. Welcomed as a trailblazer in 1959  An adult doll! With actual breasts!  she was nonetheless branded an anti-feminist a decade later when women's rights marchers chanted ""I Am Not a Barbie Doll,"" referring to her unrealistic body type (and perhaps ignoring the fact that she was single, a homeowner and a career woman). As years went by, Barbie had her hits (adopting a more inclusive body type, running for president) and misses (exclaiming ""Math class is TOUGH!""  ouch). Through it all, this lightning rod in tiny pink heels remained uniquely talented at reinventing herself. Which is why it makes sense that now, writer-director Greta Gerwig takes Barbie in more than one direction  in every direction, really  in her brash, clever, idea-packed (if ultimately TOO packed) and most of all, eye-poppingly lovely ""Barbie,"" the brand's first live action movie. Is it a celebratory homage to Barbie and her history? Yes. Also a cutting critique, and biting satire? Yes, too. The film is co-produced by Mattel, and they must have felt skittish about some elements  perhaps not Will Ferrell's reliably buffoonish Mattel CEO, but a far more serious scene where a young girl accuses Barbie of making girls feel bad about themselves. The movie's also about gender dynamics, mothers and daughters, insidious sexism ... and more. But the neatest trick is how ""Barbie,"" starring a pitch-perfect Margot Robbie  and after a minute you'll never be able to imagine anyone else doing it  can simultaneously and smoothly both mock and admire its source material. Gerwig deftly threads that needle, even if the film sags in its second half under the weight of its many ideas and some less-than-developed character arcs. In any case, boy  or should we say, girl  life in plastic looks fantastic. A head-spinning opening credits sequence begins with a Barbie history lesson, narrated by Helen Mirren. Then it's off to Barbie Land, where Barbie lives in her flamingo-pink Dreamhouse, surrounded by other Barbies in theirs. Other Barbies? Well, we know how many Barbie versions exist on store shelves, and Gerwig and her writing (and life) partner Noah Baumbach take this one step further: If they're all Barbies, that means ""Barbie"" is all of THEM. There's no one Barbie  although Robbie, who plays Stereotypical Barbie (and also produced the film), is the focal point. And every day's perfect for Stereotypical Barbie, who wakes in her heart-shaped bed, waves to neighbor Barbies, and heads to the shower, which is dry (there's no actual water, wind, sun or gravity in Barbie Land.) Her day's outfit awaits, perhaps a Chanel number, protected by shiny plastic as in a Barbie box. Then she swoops down her hot pink slide to the pool-with-no-water. The sky above is painted blue, the mountains purple. Gerwig was inspired"
240,NAF_Doc10_Barbie,NAF_Doc10_Barbie,NAF,Comedy,Positive,Barbie,"For the better part of a year or so, we've been inundated with ""Barbie"" hype. That's included articles about people jumping on the Barbie fashion trend, numerous quippy sound bites from the film's cast (but mostly Ryan Gosling), and coverage of folks vying to stay inside a life-size Barbie house. It's often felt as though our brains have been seized by residents of Barbieland. And for the most part, it seems like many of us haven't minded that one bit. With Barbie always trending on social media, it was inevitable to participate in memory loops of having the dolls as children. Or, at our worst, to engage in unproductive quarrels defending them to naysayers who advised that the toys did more harm to our body and racial image than we admit. Amid all of that, though, emerged a most intriguing question: Is ""Barbie"" feminist? Granted, the Mattel doll  and it cannot be emphasized enough that it is just a doll  is quite literally a plastic manifestation of the (generally white) male gaze, down to her tiny waist, blond hair and ample boobs. Oh, and she hasn't aged a day since she was launched in 1959. But she eventually took many forms across the racial spectrum, along with careers as a doctor, astronaut, pilot and more. She also owned a few homes, including the iconic dream house and beach house, and she had the best friends. All of this makes the answer to the feminist question, as applied to the doll, quite nuanced  fascinatingly so. But applied to the movie? That's proved to be even more complex, if for different reasons. It's important, though, to ask: Why does it matter at all if a movie is feminist? The short answer is, it doesn't. This kind of expectation has risen in the social media age as some audiences place the qualifier on certain pop culture offerings, regardless of whether that comports with the reality or has anything to do with their merit. But, as we've seen many times in the past, twist any story hard enough and it can absolutely become a feminist movie. And maybe even be good. ""Barbie"" kinda falls into that assessment. Directed by Greta Gerwig and co-written with her partner, Noah Baumbach, the movie is a vivid amalgamation of mainstream expectations, obvious brand recognition and the ambitions that the film's creators wanted to explore on their own. The New York Times reported that when Gerwig was approached about writing the film, ""the parameters were extremely broad: She could do anything she wanted."" Well, after watching the movie, it feels easier to believe that it was perhaps anything inside of already branded confines. On the positive end, ""Barbie"" has a lot to offer within its just-under-two-hour running time. It's heartfelt, sexy, weird, naive, feminist-lite and pink. Like, so very pink. Its hue, more than anything else, is the most visually striking aspect of the movie. ""Barbie"" is not particularly feminist. It's a lot more complicated than"
241,OIB_Doc1_Oblivion,OIB_Doc1_Oblivion,OIB,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"I can honestly say I completely bought into this premise. For the most part it's a well conceived storyline that undeniably takes from several other familiar sci-fi films. But it works for me mainly because of how intelligently it took all of these components and put them together to form what I think is a very competent and compelling science fiction piece. The story itself grabbed me and pulled me into this visual spectacle and I never found myself wanting to check out. The movie also managed to surprise me. I knew there were twists involved and I had my eyes open for that. For the most part it kept me off balance and had me looking in every direction trying to guess where things were going. While I did eventually figure some things out before they were revealed on screen, it didn't hurt my experience whatsoever. I also appreciate how this wasn't a movie of wall-to-wall action. Don't misunderstand me, there is action, some of it spectacular. But to my surprise the movie spent more time deliberately peeling off layers to the story. Now it may move too glacially for some but I really responded to this approach.With all that praise being said, I did think the film flirted with convention a bit too much in the final act. It's not that it's terrible and poorly done but for me it didn't really fit with the way the movie had progressed up to that point. I'm being pretty vague but let's just say things are a little too on the nose. And while I do think the three main characters aren't fully developed for good reasons, there are some characters and a particularly important plot point that felt terribly underwritten. This effected a rather important turn that the film takes later on. I'll also add that there was one big special effects money shot at the end that I felt was a pretty humdrum. Considering the dazzling effects we had been given up till then, I was expecting a bigger payoff. I'll leave it at that. Those are my only gripes and even though they do restrain ""Oblivion"" from being one of the great science fiction pictures, they didn't kill my experience. In fact I like the film a great deal. Cruise gives another strong lead performance and he's helped by solid work from Kurylenko and Riseborough. The eye-popping visuals help create a futuristic wonder and the Iceland locations give a perfect sense of desolation. And I haven't even mentioned the marvelous sound design and the soundtrack from M83 which I found to be a really nice fit. There's just so much I liked about ""Oblivion"". And while I can't just completely overlook its handful of flaws, they're easy to get past especially when you were as intrigued and glued to the screen as I was."
242,OIB_Doc2_Oblivion,OIB_Doc2_Oblivion,OIB,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"This is the type of 21st century major studio film I have come to loathe. Although the production notes claim this to be ""an original and groundbreaking cinematic event,"" they also state that it is based on the ""graphic novel created by Joseph Kosinski"" (who is the director of the film). However, it seems to me to be clearly based on a radio show, that was originally broadcast on November 26, 1950 entitled Universe, written by Robert Henlein that told almost the same story. I heard Greg Bell's 1951 rebroadcast of the show on XM radio's Classic Radio channel approximately a month ago. I haven't seen Kosinski's graphic novel (a supercilious term for a long comic book), but this story is so shockingly similar to Henlein's story that it strains credulity to believe that the creators of this film were not greatly influenced or inspired by Henlein's story. There are five writing credits, so I won't bother to mention them here, especially since I suspect that the story was purloined from the aforementioned radio show. Even so, the script is well-written and the story captivating. Although it runs for over two hours, Kosinski keeps the pace moving. The story is told well as at the beginning the tension starts and doesn't let up until the final scenes. Surprising for special effectsdriven movies like this, the cast is top-flight, including Morgan Freeman, Leo, and Olga Kurylenko, who seems to be making an appearance in almost every movie I see recently. Like many modern movies, this is clearly aimed at the videogame crowd, because the special effects are straight out of that genre. Normally these kinds of things are a big bore. But here they are essential to the plot and are of high quality so do not overwhelm the movie. The film is visually stunning, shot with a new Sony F65 digital camera, it has clarity four times a High Def image. There are a lot of stunts in the film and it is claimed the Cruise does them all himself. I'm generally dubious of claims (and it's almost always that stars claim to perform their own stunts) that a huge star would risk himself on dangerous stunts and that production companies and insurance companies would allow a star upon which the success of the film depends to take such risks, but that's what they claim. If he did do them, they are impressive. I came out of this film pleasantly surprised. The less you know about the plot, the more you will enjoy the film. But shame on them for not giving Henlein any credit."
243,OIB_Doc3_Oblivion,OIB_Doc3_Oblivion,OIB,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"Great effort is made to make Oblivion a mind-blowing experience on par with The Matrix. But with so many questions needing answers, some answers we guess on our own and others we do not. Some are satisfying developments; others, not so much. The twists and reveals along the way are aplenty, perhaps one too many, and only slightly do they distract us from Kosinski's true achievement in the filmhis visual precision. With production designer Darren Gilford and cinematographer Claudio Miranda (Oscar-winner for Life of Pi), Kosinski's film looks detailed and immaculate, every shot rendered with almost computerized perfection from one to the nextan intentional choice, no doubt. Costume designer Marlene Stewart dons the characters in symbolic (and therein deceptive) color assignments. Certainly, if Jack's white leather flight suit is the orderly uniform of a hero, and the black Darth Vader-esque masks of the Scavs are meant to denote their presumed evil, then Victoria's alternating gray-white wardrobe suggests her ambivalence toward the truth behind their mission. Foremost in the viewer's eye are the designs for the gadgets, ships, colossal machines, and spacecraft on display, all conceived with geometric and futuristic applications of clean lines and elegant if emblematic shapes. Jack's spaceship looks suspiciously like a sperm and the Tet a uterus, and so we anticipate their eventual if obvious union in the finale. Kosinski's use of the expansive Icelandic locales provides a stark contrast to the cold machinery, and his frame often takes a panoramic view to stress the vastness of Nature and the fallen structures (mostly from New York City; the Empire State Building and Brooklyn Bridge have considerable ""roles"") littering the surroundings, versus Jack's comparably tiny flying sperm contraption and compact motorbike. Oblivion's characters do little more than service the puzzle-based plot, leaving the sometimes predictable dialogue to the actors to enhance. Fortunately, Cruise's intensity dial is turned up, as usual, while Kurylenko, Leo, and Freeman provide a solid supporting cast. British actress Riseborough, who can be seen in everything from Welcome to the Punch and Disconnect as of late, brings an air of desperation needed for her role in what must be named as the film's only standout performance. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Mama) and Zoe Bell (Death Proof) also have small supporting roles, although their presence feels underdeveloped or perhaps edited down in post-production. But it's Kosinski's visual character, the crispness of his production, and the energy of his laser-blasting action sequences that prove more diverting, enough to make Oblivion solid entertainment for sci-fi aficionados, even if Kosinski's ambitious ideas and grandeur-laden tone feel underwhelming. Kosinski, whose upcoming projects are also in the sci-fi genre, seems one or two films away from making something truly unforgettablea genre film that balances heady ideas, impressive visuals, and a sharp script (recent examples of this: Inception, Looper, District 9, Moon, and J.J. Abrams' Star Trek) is nearly in Kosinski's grasp, but not yet. Nevertheless, what he achieves here is an improvement over TRON: Legacy by being an always entertaining escape. In terms"
244,OIB_Doc4_Oblivion,OIB_Doc4_Oblivion,OIB,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"The temptation to name off all the films Oblivion clearly lifts from is strong. Yes, as I watched it, nearly half a dozen other titles popped to mind. Director Joseph Kosinski, along with screenwriters Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt, fill this story with visual and plot references that are too familiar to go unnoticed. I will refrain from naming said references in order to keep major secrets hidden. Granted, Kosinski's direction is apt, the art design impressive, and the performances feel authentic. On a pure surface level, the film is well made, with sufficient entertainment value. The filmmakers come very close to getting away with borrowing recycled ideas, but this seems like it was aimed at an audience that has never seen a science fiction film before. For those that have, I wonder if they'll be able to shake how unoriginal it is. he success of the film rides on how much the audience is willing to buy the twists and turns in store for them. There are quite a few surprises, and if you step back and examine them from a distance, they do appear somewhat silly. Luckily, any absurdity is masked by an effective production. I've developed into a bit of a Tom Cruise defender. Whether or not you like him, you can't say that he doesn't step into a role with 100% commitment. Melissa Leo is also memorable in the small role of Sally, Jack's and Victoria's contact aboard the TET. Her robotic, telemarketer-like delivery had me chuckling. Morgan Freeman unfortunately gets the short end of the stick here playing Beech, leader of a band of human renegades. This was an opportunity for Freeman to step away from those wise-old-man characters he normally plays, but the script sadly does not give him enough to work with. As for the direction, I liked how Kosinski and his crew developed this world. Remnants of the past pop up underneath rubble and dirt. One particularly striking image is of the Empire State Building being nearly buried, with only its very top exposed. The action set pieces, while noticeably made with CGI, are rendered well enough to be believable, especially the drones, which appear to have weight and presence within scenes. While the set and prop design has a level of coherence and consistency, one misstep was the soundtrack. The booming and thumping music becomes an endless distraction, exposing itself all throughout. Even the more subtle scenes are accompanied with overly aggressive music. But the biggest fault with Oblivion is how it fails to provide its own voice. Informed viewers will call out how derivative much of it is, and that is a problem if you're trying to make something people will remember. In terms of simply being engaging for a two-hour span, it does accomplish that, but it had the potential to be more. Great sci-fi movies use their premises to comment on current social issues, or pose philosophical questions on human nature. This film takes its material and simply"
245,OIB_Doc5_Oblivion,OIB_Doc5_Oblivion,OIB,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"It's not often that I find myself recommending that a film be seen in IMAX, but the simple truth is that's about the only way to see Oblivion to really get anything out of the otherwise formulaic and meandering film. Based upon an unpublished graphic novella by the director, Oblivion has Tom Cruise as one of the few remaining drone repairmen assigned to Earth. The Earth's surface has been left in devastation after a war with the alien Scavs, but on one of his missions back to Earth Cruise's Jack Harper discovers a crashed spacecraft that calls into question everything he's ever believed about the war and may even put the fate of mankind into his hands. Oh, that's all. Oblivion isn't a particularly interesting film. It's sort of stuck between being an action/thriller and an intelligent sci-fi flick, but it never really makes its way far enough into the action to truly please fans of high adventure sci-fi nor will it truly satisfy those who like to analyze and over-analyze the meaning behind the meaning of their science fiction films. This is never a bad film, but it also never really rises above its mediocrity with the definite exception of being a truly beautiful film to watch that makes good use of its special effects and reveals the potential that Cruise likely saw when he signed on for the project. Director Joseph Kosinski also directed Tron: Legacy, and it's pretty apparent that Kosinski has learned a thing or two since that film. He still hasn't mastered the art of telling a cohesive and fully developed story, a lacking that becomes ever more significant as the film winds down just past the two-hour mark. I enjoyed the initial story in Oblivion quite a bit more than that in Tron: Legacy, though this film goes on a good 20 minutes or so too long and loses its consistency of tone far too frequently throughout its running time. That said, it's a more defined story structure that at least gets our interest even if it doesn't manage to quite hold onto it. The best thing about the film may very well be its magnificent original score from the French electronic band M83, a score that does everything a really good score is supposed to do in serving as companion to the film and facilitating its journey without dominating it. The most unusual thing about Oblivion, on the other hand, may very well be that Tom Cruise is surprisingly irrelevant within the context of the film with co-star Andrea Riseborough really enjoying most of the film's emotionally resonant and visually satisfying journeys. The film's first half, which largely focuses on Cruise and Riseborough, is easily its most satisfying. It's not Olga Kurylenko's fault that the film really spirals downward when she arrives on the scene contained within a crashed spacecraft, but more the fault of a story that goes from haunting and hypnotic to melodramatic and meandering. If you really want to check"
246,OIB_Doc6_Oblivion,OIB_Doc6_Oblivion,OIB,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"despite the very epic and strong visuals, I did found this film lacking. The problem I have with Oblivion has nothing to do with Tom Cruise (who I thought was superb) or the rest of the cast who deliver strong and heartfelt performances. The problem sadly lies with the plot. It felt slightly backwards. The first 2/3 of the film sets up the plot nicely. It easily establishes how we find Earth in the aftermath of the invasion. It's introduces the character of Jack Harper as we see his mind constantly battle between two conflicts. The first conflict is his honourable duty to his partner, Victoria (played by Andrea Riseborough) and the mission. Maintain control, fix drones and they get to go home. The second conflict is the dreams he has of another past life and most importantly, another woman. Who was this woman who haunted his dreams and why does he seem to be the only one affected by it? It shouldn't be possible as both Jack and Victoria both had a security memory wipe, which is suppose to keep their memories hidden beneath the surface so they could only focus on the objective.Now before I get unto that twist, it's important to remember that sci-fi is a genre that is heavily borrowed and flawed. There is not one ounce of film that you can't recognise from another film or a TV show. Star Wars for example, is homage to films of the 1930s where our heroes have to rescue the princess from a trapped dungeon on the Death Star, the same way in which a knight in shining armour would rescue the princess in the tower of a castle. But what makes certain sci-fi films stand out and classify them as the best (e.g. Blade Runner, Gattaca, John Carpenter's The Thing, District 9, Wall-E etc.), is the ability to take those familiar concepts and rework them for their own needs, stamping their own authority into a cohesive storyline. Unfortunately Oblivion uses these familiar concepts in a way that it feels like a rip off and if you have seen enough sci-fi films like I have, then the references can be easily spotted. The red eyes on the drones are from 2001: A Space Odyssey  an ode to the psychotic computer, Hal. The radiation zone is a nod to Planet of the Apes with the forbidden zone where Charlton Heston learnt the truth of what happened to the human race. The idea of the human race being used as slaves could have been a scene from The Matrix. The way Jack collects old relics from the past to keep his memories alive is comparable to Christian Bale's performance in the underrated Equilibrium. Like Christian Bale and Tom Cruise, their characters experience emotions and memories that drive them to do what they strongly believe in. The Scavs (the human resistance force who are trying to preserve humanity) are dressed like the alien predator (without the fangs)...from Predator . The"
247,OIB_Doc7_Oblivion,OIB_Doc7_Oblivion,OIB,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"All style, no substance is the refrain that ran through my head watching writer/director Joseph Kosinski's latest film, Oblivion. This is also the precise sentiment created by his previous film, Tron: Legacy. Though the Tom Cruise-starring science fiction adventure is breathtaking to look at, there is nothing to the film aside from the visuals. Bland, predictable, and frankly boring, Oblivion is an empty stylistic exercise, and feels like a slick bit of advertising, not a movie. Filmed in IMAX with Sony's new CineAlta F65 camera, Oblivion does look fantastic. Watching drone repairman Jack Harper (Cruise) blast through the wrecked-up wasteland of a post-alien invasion New York City on a futuristic dirt bike, past the strewn carcasses of container ships and submarines, is spectacular. Or when he floats through the ruined world in his bubble ship, the special effects are crisp and clean, and blend seamlessly with the frame. They're so good you don't notice them. But the entire film reminds you of those IMAX movies you saw as a kid, where a helicopter mounted camera sweeps around the rim of an active volcano, or dives into the Grand Canyon. The biggest problem in Oblivion is that it has about as much story, character, and emotional involvement as those clinical, removed IMAX movies. When you do get to the action sequences, which are woefully sparse, Kosinski has a good eye and moves the film along nicely, but the rest of the time you're left holding an empty bag. The acting is flat and vapid. Kurylenko spends all of her screen time with a kicked puppy dog expression that makes her look like she thinks she's about to be slapped. Cruise just looks confused for two hours, and Riseborough's face is an expressionless blank. Melissa Leo's southern drawl is an atrocious caricature, a deliberate one, but still obnoxious. Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau are completely squandered; they probably don't have a dozen lines between them. And you can pilot Jack's bubble ship through the gaping plot holes. You spend most of the movie asking, why did they...how did they... did they not see that coming? Oblivion may be a masterwork on the visual side, but it is a complete void in every other arena. To paraphrase a friend, it's too bad they didn't cut one of the massive effects pieces and use that money to buy a story or some characters. You can spot obvious lifts from WALL-E, Planet of the Apes, The Matrix, RoboCop, Star Wars, and any number of other sci-fi movies, but even wearing your influences on your sleeve in such a manner can't save a dreadfully dull movie. You want Oblivion to be more, but it has nothing else to offer, and at its worst, it's tedious and difficult to sit through."
248,OIB_Doc8_Oblivion,OIB_Doc8_Oblivion,OIB,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"The boisterous space-aged yarn 'Oblivion' is a post-apocalyptic popcorn pleaser that may be met with mixed reception depending on your definition of tolerance for rousing, recycled sci-fi cinema. On one hand, the positive outlook is that 'Oblivion' boasts what moviegoers routinely expect from a typical Tom Cruise vehicle  a flashy actioner with hotshot Tom Terrific pushing the excitable buttons in what amounts to be revved-up flick dipped in radiant shades of vibrancy. Naturally, Cruise is no stranger to the genre of fantasy-filled flamboyant escapism where saving the world from ruination is top priority. As for the less-than-positive vibes that blemish 'Oblivion', the sentiment is such that the futuristic Cruise-control caper never quite captures an imaginative or distinctive tone while running on the straight-forward fumes of other borrowed concepts from current and nostalgic sci-fi fare. Instead of soaking in the whimsical wonderment of 'Oblivion's surrealistic scope one finds the need to recognise how much the carbon copy material undermines what could have been an intriguing action-adventure with its own sense of style, substance and sensuality.Although opulent, ambitious and populated with fine performers that try to breathe some creative life into the sporadic script, 'Oblivion' is stiff thematically and fails to deliver a premium-plus pulse of twitchy intrigue and surging suspense. Theoretically, 'Oblivion' has all the top-notch zip of a 'Battlestar Galactica' TV re-run from the early 80s. Can Jack Harper learn his true identity and not compromise his heroic duties to protect the vulnerable world from being further impoverished? Does Harper have enough stamina to contain the computerised orbs from demolishing a deteriorating Earth with his awesomely designer jet? How does Cruise's nifty-minded narration compare to the velvet voiceover mastery of Oscar-winner Morgan Freeman as one of the space station dignitaries onboard? How soon after the mission can Harper join the remaining survivors on the distant lunar colony? Is the wrecked Earth worth saving or is the effort to safeguard it from further degradation futile? Just how complicated is the three-way love affair with Jack and his two objects of affection in Vicca and Ms. Empire State Building beauty? Director Joseph Kosinski ('Tron: Legacy') and screenwriters Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt revisit familiar territory here and particularly do not have anything original, impish or introspective to offer beyond the confines of a mechanical sci-fi fable that marches to the beat of other cinematic influences. Shamelessly, 'Oblivio'n taps into such reminiscences of 'Star Wars', 'The Matrix', 'Total Recall', 'The Book Of Eli' and 'Phantasm' (and even Cruise's signature free-wheeling classic 'Top Gun') that one is left wondering why Kosinski's Xerox-coated narrative did not dip into other possible targets for consideration.'Oblivion' is based on the co-creative collaboration of Kosinski's unpublished graphic novel. There is a crystal bluish hypnotic aura that gives the film a mesmerizing mystique visually. It is too bad that the cinematic aesthetics outmaneuver the patchy script that conveniently recalls selective film recollections without trying to conceive anything fresh and frolicking on its own merit. Sadly, this is nothing more"

In fact, everything in this movie keeps looking backward. Victoria warns Jack that ""Our job is to not remember. Remember?"" That's the cue for this company man with a rebellious streak to find his future in the past, to decide if he's fishing for memory or waking up inside of a dream. Jack must attend to the dual meaning of ""oblivion"": ""nothing"" and ""forgetfulness."" If we've misplaced our memories, we've lost ourselves.The movie's trailer and poster have alerted viewers that Jack and Victoria are not alone on Earth. Morgan Freeman briefly emerges from the underworld as a Zeus-Hades insurgent, sporting sunglasses and chomping on a cigar. (Where'd he find that  in a subterranean smoke shop?) Melissa Leo, with a fake-syrupy Southern accent, is seen on Riseborough's screen as a mid-level operative back at Mission Control. And Kurylenko, also in theaters now as Ben Affleck's whirling wife in Terrence Malick's To the Wonder, eventually shows up in person when Jack rescues her from a shot-down spaceship on which she had taken a long cryogenic nap. (No surprise: she looks great.) But Oblivion is still so underpopulated that. when Jack requires a suitable rival for a bare-knuckles fight, it's a clone of himself.Kosinski, the 3-D graphics whiz who has a Master's degree in architecture from Columbia University, made his feature-film debut with the 2010 Tron: Legacy (a sequel-remake that also hopscotches through time). Oblivion shows that Kosinski certainly has an eye for spiffy shapes  the sleek watchtower, the collapsible metallic grandeur of Jack's aircraft, the platoon of drones with one glowering red eye and the frowny face of a Pac-man goblin amid a ravishingly barren landscape. Indeed, the juggling of opposites is this director's game: to make an artistic statement while indulging his star's need to be a Top Gun aerial ace, a moto-bike demon and an old-fashioned romantic swain.Cruise nearly carries it off. At 50, with a few becoming facial creases but also looking cryogenically preserved, he is still the boyish action star, a perpetual-motion machine who's been told No so many times he's stopped listening and leaped into the enthralling unknown. The extreme closeups that find only generic worry in Riseborough's face are kind to Cruise; he instinctively knows how to communicate to an audience through a possibly thoughtful stare. (We haven't seen the old-young smiling Tom on the big screen for ages; he's taken Will Smith's lead and traded in his trademark grin for a world-weary grimace.) After playing the dessicated Stacee Jaxx in Rock of Ages, and the hobo sleuth in Jack Reacher, Cruise completes his Jack trilogy as Harper, spelunking inside the crevices of his memory or fantasy.The exigencies of Cruise's participation demand fights and flights. We get one pretty cool space dogfight, as Jack plays bumper cars"
250,OIB_Doc10_Oblivion,OIB_Doc10_Oblivion,OIB,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"When a movie engages in the argument of DNA being the source of a human's memories and identity, one finds very few scenarios in search of plausible conclusions. In the recent ""Moon,"" those ideas were echoed in meditative passages that refused to be decisive, imploring audiences to consider the uncertainty rather than revel in final explanations. In a more popular example, ""Alien Resurrection"" featured a story arc of the character of Ellen Ripley being cloned hundreds of years after her death, and the replica seemed to possess vague hints of the original's memories and feelings. How are these threads of reasoning possible? Are they possible at all, even? The doubt emphasizes the joyous continuity of the great sci-fi fables of our lifetime, echoing the words of Phillip K. Dick or the visions of Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott in their desire to ask questions impossible to answer in simple episodes. To reply to them with conclusive reasoning is to defy the core intentions of this genre, which means to leave the discussion open for our inspired minds.I call on ""Moon"" as my primary example because it is easily the most successful of recent films. Simple, focused and deafening in its blatant absence of soundtrack cues and verbal explanations, the movie possesses a spirit that is relentless in setting the right tone for the subject matter. The last of the ""Alien"" pictures was not nearly as successful, and only glossed over the concept long enough to propel the narrative forward without having to explain much of it. What makes this discussion relevant here? Because it is the most important  and interesting  message in the new ""Oblivion,"" a post-apocalyptic science fiction thriller starring Tom Cruise as a technician whose memory of a collapsed world is wiped clean for the sake of... who knows? There are many other questions that follow it, too  can memories, if they are even our own, be truly erased without leaving behind an echo? Are we all missing important details in our detached state of societal unrest? And in the absence of individualism, are we really projecting the truth onto what we see, or are the smoke and mirrors overwhelming our consciousness?Most movies would crash under the weight of such stimulating thoughts, but ""Oblivion"" seems perfectly comfortable with the material. The downside is that it does not arrive at any persuasive argument because it is too focused on absorbing the ideas of greater films, without the inclination to display them in a manner that is of worthy inheritance. The attempts are noble and enthusiastic, and sometimes even stylistic. But this is a far cry from the contemplative looks into the human mind that were exhibited in ""2001"" or ""Minority Report."" In other words, it's the standard issue of our modern movie awareness, a film that makes good on its promise of effective action and visuals but not really much else.There is much more to this story than I intend to reveal, which is more to"
251,OPA_Doc1_Uncharted,OPA_Doc1_Uncharted,OPA,Action,Positive,Uncharted,"So, I'm not saying this movie was a masterpiece or anything. It's really just a nice popcorn action movie, and a pretty good interpretation of the Uncharted stories, which I felt, really captured the spirit and the vibes of the game series, even though it's not exactly like the games. Cons: I definitely had some problems with it. The one I keep hearing from everybody is Mark Wahlberg as Sully. To be completely honest, I don't think he's the best Sully, or much like the character from the games at all. But after about halfway through the movie, I really enjoyed his comedic chemistry with Tom Holland and didn't mind so much about his inclusion, since what's really important in an Uncharted movie is how the characters are able to interact with one another in entertaining ways. This movie totally has that. There were definitely some noticeable green screen moments too, especially when characters are being backlit by daylight. It's noticeable if you've seen a lot of action movies. The Papa John's sponsorship thing. It was just one little line, but it was noticeable. Didn't take me out of the movie that much, but it was there. At least it wasn't as bad as that Bud light sponsorship in that other Mark Wahlberg action movie (jesus christ Transformers 4 sucked). If you've seen some Indiana Jones adventure type plots in the past, you're probably going to able to predict whats going to happen much of the time. It's not bad if you enjoy those things, but there's something to be said for a movie's ability to surprise you, and this one isn't going to blow anybody away with it's plot structure. But that's about it for the cons for me. Uncharted is a popcorn entertainment series of games. Nothing super deep, just bombastic action with some spicy quippy lines between characters in between, throw in a little climbing and shooting and you got yourself an Uncharted experience. And this movie delivered on what I think Uncharted feels like, and that's quite an accomplishment. It really feels like Uncharted. There's a lot of fan service too if you're in it for that, and I think it was tastefully done for the most part. I'm sure a lot of the negative reception for this movie is going to be centered around how ""it's not like the games"". So, I think the games are brilliant, but it doesn't mean that those games are going to translate well to a 2 hour movie. In each game, you have 8-14 hours to get to know each character, and in 2 hours you need a script that can fit introductions, character arcs, and plot information. That's hard to do. But despite my worries about this movie falling apart at multiple levels, I found the writing to be pretty well done. Not anything groundbreaking or entirely new, but I felt like Tom Holland did an excellent job portraying a young adult Nathan Drake. I don't think anyone"
252,OPA_Doc2_Uncharted,OPA_Doc2_Uncharted,OPA,Action,Positive,Uncharted,"Yes, I know. You want to watch an adaptation of the game. The movie is not the movie version of the game but just hear me out: I've played all of the games in the series and I liked them. While watching this movie, as I realized the movie is not like the games I was disappointed due to lots of changes. I was disappointed because I thought the movie was worse than the games but as I watched the movie more and more I personally found lots of reasons to like the movie in its own context. The movie is clearly a remake therefore there are lots of changes but it's not bad. I won't call it improvement but just take it from a different point of view. Call it a parallel universe story but I happen to like it. I don't prefer lemon but if life gives me a lemon I make lemonade and enjoy it. No point in being blue over ""but it's not an apple like my doctor ordered so"", right? First of all Nathan Drake's personality is full of life and cunning and he uses his intelligence for being a humorous person which these didn't change in the movie. What's different in the movie is that in the games when he was trying to be humorous, he seemed a bit childish like a clown, but in the movie he is more like being mature and intelligent. Immature people don't understand how laughing is better than crying therefore a part of being mature is being sarcastic at the right time which may make you sound humorous and thus makes you laugh or it makes you passive-aggressive and it gives other the message of what you mean and what will happen if they continue whatever the BS they doing. In the games Nathan can't be mature for one second which is annoying but in the movie Nathan finally grew up as a person but ironically he looks like a teen kid compared to the game Nathan who looks like a man. In the game Victor seemed like the very unnecessary person to me therefore I didn't pay attention to his existence most of the time. In the movie Victor is an interesting and very different person in a good way. In the game Nathan and Victor had no harmony between them. Game Victor seemed more like a creepy paedophile bisexual old man who simping over every character but the movie Victor is not a pervert or a weird ""good guy"" like the game Victor. Movie Victor is a wise and mature man like how I would want game Victor to be. I don't remember game Chloe to even judge her. In the movie Chloe is also not an interesting character but she is somewhat not primitive as the game Chloe. Even the appearance of these characters looks better in the movie and their personality is better. Though appearance of the characters and their personality had no affect"
253,OPA_Doc3_Uncharted,OPA_Doc3_Uncharted,OPA,Action,Positive,Uncharted,"TLDR: Best Video Game movie ever. As a fan of series, I really enjoyed it. Don't listen to critics and reviews, if you feel at all like seeing it, give it a chance and form your own opinion. I have seen a lot of negativity towards this movie, but as a huge fan of the game series I can confirm that atleast in my opinion and in the opinion of my GF who is also a fan of the series this movie was really good. I'd say best Video game movie ever made. The movie is it's own thing to an extent, that is what I want to say from the beginning. It does not require you to have played the games nor follow exact storylines from the games. It takes inspiration and scenes from the game and has enough in common with the games with its cool nods to the franchise but in the end is it's own thing and does it well. And if you can look past that I think you'll enjoy this like I did. So elephant in the room is the Cast. I'll just come out and say that I think Tom and Mark pulled it off. I was skeptical as everyone at first, but they won me over and the chemistry really worked. I really liked Tom's portrayal even tho it is different than Nolan's original. It is more boyish in parts but taps in to the humor and charm of original. And that works as Tom is here playing younger Drake as in Drake before the games. And Mark also can pull his own as Sully and they work well together. Same also goes for rest of the cast. Chloe's actor is good and also fit's to the role. She brings some good banter and twists to the relationship of the trio (Nathan, Sully, Chloe). Again somewhat different than the original portrayal in the games but still work IMO. I can admit without spoiling that twist with the villain, I wasn't fan of. I really liked the actor who seemed to be the main villain but in the end wasn't and would've liked to see more done with it. But still the twist didn't ruin anything like some reviews have claimed. The movie also had lot of action and it was well made for most part. There was humor in combat and good choreography in the action. Also the CGI was good for most part so there actually was some money spend on this movie. There was lot of humor, wise cracks and nice Easter eggs that made my and my GF chuckle. So of course knowing Uncharted and NaughtyDogs other work will give you a better appreciation of the movie, but you can definitely see it regardless of your familiarity with the series. Overall this review is already a novel so I'd say don't listen to the critics and many reviewers out there. If you feel at all intrigued, go watch it"
254,OPA_Doc4_Uncharted,OPA_Doc4_Uncharted,OPA,Action,Positive,Uncharted,"LIKES: The Pace: It seems to be my starter, but the pace is exactly what one would want in an action/adventure movie. Like National Treasure, our ""heroes"" move through each of the locations in a rapid-fire motion, trying to race the clock and the bad guys to the clues in hopes of obtaining the prize. It balances touching moments with the high-speed thrills of the action and keeps you entertained for much of the movie. The Puzzles: Puzzles are a staple of the Uncharted franchise, alongside the traps that litter them to bar entrance to the vault. While maybe not as intricate, layered, or maybe as deadly and pressing, this film has designed some fun clues and tests for Nathan and his ""squad"" to figure out that are adventurous and fun. Like Indiana Jones with a modern skin, the movie does a fine job of bringing the fun of the games with the cleverness of the traps, and keeping in time to the pace of the movie and the general audience rating. The Music/Sound Editing: A minor like for some, the music of the movie is something like Pirates of the Caribbean, where it adds that spirt of adventure and excitement in the background. Uncharted has two types of music to set the mood, the orchestral pieces being the primary one that take both mood and amplitude and fill the speakers with that spirit of adventure as we dove into the quests at hand. Meanwhile, the quieter moments and a certain select scenes, jump into the modern-day element and spice up the mood with some toe tapping, upbeat, techno songs or maybe a little smoother jazz to mix things up, or go towards the sentiment. Great works in the sound department, Hollywood's arsenal of sound effects is set to bring all the action to life. Sprung traps, breaking bones, powerful booms, and weapon unloading, all have that added emphasis, once more pulling you more into the moment and feeling you are in the moment with them, well as much as you can be given the limited experience. The Story: It's not the most complicated, and it's not the most extensive, but for an adaptation of a video game... it again works. Uncharted took the highlights of a game's story, mixed a little more of the character moments, brought the treasure hunts in, and led to the adventure at hand. All those things added up together quite well and brought a complete tale into a two-hour run time, which is always the challenge. This should be good for the general audience, while also nodding to the nostalgia factor of the games baked in. Thus, the story is decent for a summary movie. The Action: Again, the video game makes it more involved and complex, with plenty of moments to immerse and blow our minds with traps and stunts. This movie did okay mirroring it, bringing the elements of chase moments, parkour, gun play, and close combat fighting that held enough elements"
255,OPA_Doc5_Uncharted,OPA_Doc5_Uncharted,OPA,Action,Positive,Uncharted,"I was very doubtful going into this movie as I was concerned it was going to contradict itself in terms of lore and backstory, as previously established in the games. Especially since I was EXTREMELY unhappy with the casting of Mark Wahlberg as Victor Sullivan, as his persona is so night and day with the character we see in the game That being said, I let most of that go when I was watching the movie because I was having so much fun with it! Without going into too many spoilers, yes the game's story is different from that of what we see in the games, and Mark Wahlberg's Sully isn't the same person we see in the games, but within the context of what I consider to be another version of the story, I think it works really well. Tom Holland brought his own spin on Nathan Drake and I thought he was great, Wahlberg grew on me over time as Sully and he had me invested in his character. Sophia Taylor Ali was a wonderful Chloe Frazer, and she felt like the closest to their respective character in the games if that's what you're looking for. And of course, Antonio Banderas and Tati Gabrielle were excellent villains perfect for an action adventure such as this one The story felt very appropriate for an uncharted property, and even had some winks and nods to lifelong series fans who played through a few of the exact situations in the games. It really does feel like you could make an installment in the game franchise with this exact story (With exceptions to maintain backstory consistency). Along with the action being so so so entertaining! Considering Nate's just now jumping into this life, it makes sense he's not comfortable breaking necks and getting into gunfights quite yet. But thankfully, that doesn't take away from the stakes or the excitement. The mixture of practical effects and excellent stunt work meant that the cgi they did use could have more time dedicated to it looked super clean, which I hate to say is rare nowadays Did I mention this movie is actually really funny? Props to the writers for making me laugh throughout the movie, which can become irritating if it's not done properly. I honestly can't think of a joke I heard that fell flat, and none of the comedy felt inappropriately timed, which a lot of movies tend to do, compromising the moments that need to digest as serious tonal shifts. It was well done, and I gotta give credit where it's due I do still have issues with it though, even if they are mostly nitpicks. The emotional moments didn't really stick the landing, and just about every time someone had tears in their eyes I didn't buy it. The child versions of Nate and Sam didn't have the greatest acting ability, although they weren't by any means terrible. And yeah I wish this movie was more consistent with the backstory"
256,OPA_Doc6_Uncharted,OPA_Doc6_Uncharted,OPA,Action,Negative,Uncharted,"Uncharted is a tough movie to like. It should be easy to like. It's a country-hopping action/adventure film with a likeable cast, headlined by Tom Holland, Mark Wahlberg, and Antonio Banderas, based on a cherished video game franchise. So many ingredients for a quality film, and yet what an abhorrent recipe. The film is lazy, rote, sterile. It boasts zero laughs, zero thrills, zero tension, zero surprise, all of the easier elements to a good trek film. It's under two hours but feels like three and becomes totally unglued in its final sequence. It's an impossible film to like. The film follows Nathan Drake, played by Holland, a sly amateur thief who's given a chance to go on the adventure of a lifetime by Victor Sullivan, played by Mark Wahlberg. The adventure is a chance not just to acquire gold, but to learn about the life and death of Nathan's brother Sam, whom Sully knew. The pair are helped by Chloe Frazer, played by Sophia Ali, and hounded by Santiago Moncada and Braddock, played by Banderas and Tati Gabrielle respectively. The film is best defined by three major problems. First is the lack of character introductions or working knowledge. The audience is given no information about anybody here, save for some slight backstory and the idea that no one trust anyone else, for some reason. It feels like we've been plopped down in the fourth film of the franchise and are expected to know the working relationships, dynamics, backstories, and allegiances of all central figures going in. There's backstabbing aplenty and the general team switching so prevalent in treasure hunting movies, but everyone is so ill-defined and similarly characterized these moments mean nothing to the viewer. How could they? We don't know anything about anybody. The second problem is more general, harder to specify. The film is absolutely sterile, bland. It's paint-by-numbers filmmaking, telegraphing many twists and emphasizing nothing. There's no weight to any of this, there's no intrigue or engagement. There's some hint of violence and a passing glance at brutality, but it's been watered down (way down, a throat is slashed and spills no blood, not an ounce) in order to achieve the most marketable, family friendly film possible. This is a supposedly emotional, exotic, highly complex franchise that plays like a lazier National Treasure. It's easy to assume the material's been butchered. Speaking of butchering, dear God the action scenes. Many, many sequences are greenscreened poorly and any sense of impact is interrupted by egregious editing choices. There's no sense of space or continuity either, even when there are only two parties in the fight. To compound the ineptitude, the pervasive, infuriating treatment of physics popularized by the Fast and Furious franchise is turbocharged here. Two glaring examples stick out; one outside a mid-air cargo plane and the other on the mast of a ship. Some of the plane sequence is in the first trailer; watch it, be appalled, and know that it's not an anomaly. Again,"
257,OPA_Doc7_Uncharted,OPA_Doc7_Uncharted,OPA,Action,Negative,Uncharted,"I've been a massive fan of Nathan Drake ever since the first Uncharted game released and the next three instalments gave us some of the best adventures ever made into games! The characters are solid and well written, as are the voice characters - and the stories have more action and suspense than 99.9% of all Hollywood productions! There's been talks for a very long time about making a movie of the Uncharted series and we fans wanted Nathan Fillion to play Drake. Even Nathan Fillion wanted to play Drake - so much that an awesome self-funded trailer was made to show how much he wanted to play Drake!!! It went viral the very second it was released, and for a moment we all hoped Sony would come to their senses... Sadly it was chosen to let Spiderman, aka Tom Holland to play young Drake (which we got to play in the last two games during flashback sequences) and Mark Wahlberg to play Sully. I can sort of see why they picked Tom, but Mark Wahlberg as Sully?! No way... Doesn't fit the character at all! Despite this I was excited to see which story they picked to make this movie but oh buy was I wrong... Instead of picking one of the well crafted stories they picked bits from every game, mixed it up, added some new bits and called this Uncharted... sigh. This I could've lived with, but neither the director nor the script writers had seen any of the games and instead they changed everyone and their relations, and what we got in the end was a kick in the **** to the whole fanbase - and the developers at Naughty Dog! In fact they totally ruined every character! This is such a shame because if the movie had been called ""Adventure Movie"" I would've scored it a strong 7, but like this it's a bleak 3, and that's me being nice... Talk about ruining a masterpiece. Now we probably will never get the chance of a proper Uncharted with Nathan Fillion as Drake. I would even have liked to see Nolan North (Drake voice actor, cameo on the beach) as Drake, but Nathan Fillion both looks and sounds like Drake and this is what we fans wanted, but when the director, script writers and Sony can't even bother to play or watch the games it's based upon, it'll always end up as a butchered franchise. Such a shame because this could've been a fantastic adventure movie with some of the best game characters ever made! If you know nothing about the Uncharted games you'll probably like this movie, but if you're even the slightest invested in the games I'd stay way away from this movie because you'll only get upset how they ruined the characters we've loved for so many years... Compare this to The Witcher series where Henry Cavill made sure he got the part as Geralt since he loved to play the games. They"
258,OPA_Doc8_Uncharted,OPA_Doc8_Uncharted,OPA,Action,Negative,Uncharted,"TUncharted is one of the best action-adventure video game franchises. It was like an interactive film that was inspired by films such as Indiana Jones and National Treasure. So it isn't too surprising that it got a movie adaptation. However, video game movies are known to be bad so I didn't have high expectations. Does Uncharted continue this video game movie curse or finally break out of the mould? The biggest thing I enjoyed about this film is the action sequences. They are fun to watch even though they are defying physics. The thing is though that the big action set piece is just ripped from the game. Tom Holland is a charismatic lead and it is clear he is still great at being the main lead in the film. It was also clear that Tom was giving 110% in the role. Antonio Banderas was also pleasant to watch as the villain. I love the charming yet cold nature of his performance. However, Tom Holland just doesn't feel like Nathan Drake. His character is shown to be a thief at the beginning which fits Nathan but then afterwards he becomes a saint that won't give in to greed. Nathan was never the perfect guy in the games and was kind of an a-hole at times. He also had fun quips and tend to complain about the absurdity of the situation but in this film, he is lacking in all of these qualities. The same can be said for Chloe and Sully played by Sophia Ali and Mark Wahlberg respectively. Sophia gives a fine performance but her character just keeps being very dislikable and Mark is just playing himself so Sully just ends up being bland. Antonio was doing great as the villain and had clear motives but he is replaced by Tati Gabrielle who is just underwhelming and lame. In the end, the characters are all underdeveloped and uninteresting. Another amazing aspect of the game was the action set pieces. They were just visually so awesome and Drake always felt like he was in danger and could die. This is not the case in the film. Drake never feels like he is in any mortal danger and this could be due to the silly weightless and slapstick feel of the action. There is also a fight scene at a Papa Johns that feels so shameless and blatant in product placement. Additionally, the story and writing feel so basic and predictable. The writer just copy and pasted the typical treasure hunting plot from previous movies with slight changes and called it a day. The interactions between the characters aren't funny and lack the heart that was seen in the games. Every scene of talking is either pointless or just saying exposition. Due to this the movie has so many moments where the pacing just slows completely. Overall, Uncharted (2022) is a soulless cash grab that inherited none of the qualities from its source material. It doesn't try to do anything original"
259,OPA_Doc9_Uncharted,OPA_Doc9_Uncharted,OPA,Action,Negative,Uncharted,"More like Unsharted amirite? I haven't played the games because I don't own a console, but I have watched all 3 games and most of 4's full walkthroughs, so I know these characters and their demeanors, and these two actors are not Nathan Drake and Sully. At least it seems like Tom tried a little to act like Nathan, but Mark Wahlberg didn't even try. So I know the games, but I don't have the attachment to them because playing is different than just watching. So I would've probably given it a 2 or a 3 if I played them. Anyway, Sony wanted a safe movie with a main lead that looks nothing like Nathan Drake, to bring the big bucks while Tom Holland is still a hot topic, and they made another boring soulless cash-grab that resembles nothing of the source material. Even if the story was good and set pieces were more grabbing, I still wouldn't enjoy the movie because there is no Nathan and Sully in this movie. All I see is Spider-Man and Mark Wahlberg doing a by-the-numbers action movie from the prestigious director of Venom! Nathan Drake is an iconic and popular character in gaming, and what do they do when they make a movie about him? Another generic action movie protagonist that you'll forget about 5 minutes after watching it. If you fail at making your main character feel, look and sound unique, then you've failed at making a good movie. Even worse movies with worse plots can be somewhat forgiven if they have an iconic and memorable character that stands out amongst the plethora of action movie protagonists. I'm not even gonna talk about the plot, because there's nothing to talk about. But the characterization is something that's really bad in this movie, and some of it is because I'm still seeing Tom and Mark, and not the characters they're playing. But the characterization alone is bad too. They try to do some things from the games, like the flashback and stuff, but it doesn't translate well to a movie script, and the characterization lacks. So now we have a movie that has a great source material, but instead takes a mishmash of all 3 games' stories and turns it into a 2-hour movie, hires two well-known actors for ensuring the financial success of the film, does the bare minimum with the script and gives us a cliche plot with cliche characters, turns the iconic fan-favorite characters into generic action movie protagonists and strips away every personality trait and wit they have from them. And I don't even know why I gave it a 5/10 when I didn't particularly enjoy any part of the movie, but I guess it's a somewhat well-made film that people who have never watched a movie in their life might enjoy. Watch it if you have literally nothing else to watch, and if you're a fan of the games, just watch the short film on Youtube with Nathan"
260,OPA_Doc10_Uncharted,OPA_Doc10_Uncharted,OPA,Action,Negative,Uncharted,"T""Uncharted"" can best be described as a lackluster adventure film that doomed itself into mediocrity by sitting on the fence between being an adaptation of the video game franchise, or just being its own thing. Incredibly poor casting choices for the majority of the characters compound the difficulty of finding it entertaining, and a lethargic and contrived storyline drives home the final nail. Concerning the plot, the movie mixes an ""original"" story with set pieces from the games in an awkward attempt to create an origin story for its main protagonist, Nathan Drake. While this might land decently for inattentive viewers not familiar with the source material or caring about the jumbled narrative, it creates a very confusing and irritating conundrum for those who know about Drake's past adventures and cannot reason why familier scenarios are playing out supposedly years earlier than the first game. Ultimately, this leaves the viewer with little choice but to relegate the movie into its own universe, which in turn frames the film as an inferior counterfeit in all aspects by comparison. The narrative in question follows Drake as he sets off on a journey to locate his long lost brother after having been found by a past associate of his, Victor Sullivan, and enlisted into locating a fabled treasure. After the two meet up with Sullivan's ""partner"", Chloe Frazer, the team has to contend with both a rival team chasing after the same fortune and wrestling with each other over trust issues that arise each time one of them stabs the other in the back. When the treasure is eventually discovered in a haphazard manner (the puzzle in question having two solutions that the plot conveniently sorts out), the climax creates a scenario that is equal parts inventive and logically ludicrous; but primarily underwhelming given the poor character development and portrayal of all the characters present. Needless to say, while the story isn't wholly unwatchable, its habit of skipping around and dragging between action sequences kills any semblance of intrigue the film has. By far the greatest detriment to movie, however, is its casting choices. Tom Holland's portrayal of Nathan Drake came off clunky and unbelievable, thanks largely in part to his youthful and naive appearance. Even if he wasn't compared to the characters's video game counterpart, which is impossible not to do for anyone who has seen him, his mannerisms lack any semblance of the maturity that the role calls for. Likewise, Mark Wahlberg's ""Sully"" was less of a rough-edged man of the world, and more resembling of a peddler of snake oil whose dignity was always kept at an utter minimum. While Sophia Ali's rendition of Chloe and Antonio Banderas's Santiago were both somewhat entertaining, both suffered removal by the time the final act came around: making their appearences in the film negligible in the long run. Lastly, Tati Gabrielle's Braddock fell completely flat in terms of overall threat, which in turn made the final conflict she appeared in bland and underwhelming."

Those who survived knew that mankind could never survive a fourth; the volatile nature of human beings would only increase, ensuring continued ruination. So, with classic governmental overreach on the horizon, a new organization is formed: the Grammaton Cleric, whose elite soldiers have only one purpose  to eradicate the true source of man's inhumanity to man, which is his ability to feel. In walks John Preston (Christian Bale), a first-class cleric, tasked with wiping out yet another stronghold of emotion and creativity  a stash house of music, art, books, and various trinkets that reflect the remnants of traditional human society. In a rather unintentionally comical moment, Preston stares down the recovered Mona Lisa painting before ordering it to be burned. In this peaceful yet bleak future, any item that might spark feelings is dubbed EC-10 or ""sense offense"" material, which warrants immediate destruction. A drug called Prozium is administered to citizens at regular intervals (mandated by alarm bells sounded off in the city centers and available at Equilibrium buildings), which helps suppress emotions on a personal, chemical basis. But despite all of these precautions, including Vice Counsel Dupont (Angus MacFadyen) routinely interviewing his staff, Preston's partner Errol Partridge (Sean Bean) succumbs to the forbidden, finer things in life  such as poetry by Yeats. After discovering Partridge's indiscretions, John executes the man, betraying no emotion at all. Or does he? With each criminal he apprehends, Preston begins to realize that living without feelings negates the very reason to be alive. It may be a complete rip-off of ""1984""  and by extension, ""Brazil,"" ""Gattaca,"" and ""The Matrix""  or any of the other countless, futuristic, oppressive-regime/soul-crushing, postapocalyptic civilization movies, but ""Equilibrium"" is one of the better ones. If a picture is going to borrow heavily from works before it, it might as well loot from the best. It also helps tremendously that writer/director Kurt Wimmer was able to acquire such a talented cast  from Bale's efficiency as a dispassionate soldier to the high caliber of notable supporting players like Emily Watson, Sean Bean, and William Fichtner. Even child star Matthew Harbour is exceptional. Great actors, however, can't solely redeem the more mediocre materials in play. There are plenty of overly familiar ideas, such as a Resistance, the ""processing"" of underground fighters, and the involvement of an unseen, supreme leader named ""Father."" To counter this, there are also a few new concepts, such as the gunkata martial arts form (essentially kung-fu with shooting weapons) and the parallels of Preston's downward spiral with that of his partner (along with the well-kept secrets of his wife and children). Unfortunately, rather than exploring the thought-provoking side of fascistic rule, or the tragedies of discovering the righteousness of the opposition and failing to protect loved ones, ""Equilibrium"" goes for the heavy-handed approach. Shooting puppies, striking absurd poses, and abusing slow-motion for the sake of over-the-top action sequences might"

It feels uncomfortable even typing those words, as they sound like the typical soundbite blurb-speak that passes for so much of film criticism these days. But it's true: This medium-budgeted, futuristic action tale that arrives on screens with precious little fanfare is, to my mind, the best film I've seen all year. It's a movie that thrilled and moved and deeply affected me when I got the chance to see it at a very early advance screening last July, and hasn't been out of my mind in the months since. I've been heaping praise on it for so many months  to friends, colleagues, family...pretty much anyone who'd listen  that it almost feels like I've written this review already. Writer/director Kurt Wimmer has delivered an intelligent and honorable riff on such science fiction classics as George Orwell's 1984, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, presenting a not-too-distant future where freedom has been traded for security (a timely subject these days!) through the State-mandated use of emotion-suppressing drugs. War and crime and hate are things of the past in Equilibrium's world, but so are art and creativity and love. This nightmare is presided over by the Big Brother-like dictator Father, and enforced by a quasi-religious order of ""Clericks,"" whose incredible combat skills are unleashed on ""sense offenders"" who have gone off the drugs that keep the populace docile. A terrifying future, to be sure, though not one without hope  especially when Clerick John Preston (Christian Bale, a much more impressive action hero here than he was fighting dragons in Reign of Fire) accidentally misses his drug dose and begins to feel for the first time. I hesitate to reveal much more about the plot of Equilibrium, jammed as it is with surprise and invention  suffice to say, this is an intellectual rollercoaster ride, as cerebral as it is visceral; both a bleak glimpse into a possible future and a stirring tribute to the indomitable human spirit. Though the film gets immeasurable mileage out of its cinematography, stunning futuristic production design, and music (an awesome neo-Wagnerian choral score by Klaus Badelt, a frequent collaborator of Hans Zimmer), it's (not surprisingly) the performers who give the proceedings so much gravity. Bale has never been better, combining the sleek coldness that served him so well as Patrick Bateman in American Psycho with a heartbreaking portrayal of a man rediscovering his lost humanity (and paying for the recovery of that humanity: Wimmer cleverly has the violence become more intense and wrenching as Preston learns to feel again). Bale is strongly supported by Emily Watson (one of the most soulful actresses working today, here perfectly cast as a beautiful sense offender who spurs Preston's rebellion against the system), Taye Diggs (having a wicked good time as Preston's suspicious partner), and Angus MacFadyen (sinister and oddly mournful as the head Clerick). This is a cast who seem to be giving their all in"

I thought about Orwell he'd probably approve of this film. The center for which all the soldiers come from is called ""Equilibrium"" or balance as it is layman's terms; they're all injected with an opium drug that they carry that numbs their emotions and sense of guilt while they're controlled by the heavily armed heavily secure government facility. Paired with incredible direction and writing by Kurt Wimmer and sleek stylish cinematography by Dion Beebe, we're given a glimpse into a world that's still imperfect despite it being under control. In a society now completely void of emotion, heavily armed guards patrol the streets with the use of their skilled warriors called the Grammaton Clericks, a band of sleek swift emotionless soldiers who can take on a horde of rebels without breaking a sweat. Their best soldier is Sean Preston, an emotionless professional and violent soldier who one day remembers his wife whom he betrayed to be killed for feeling and now his memories begin flooding back as well with his emotions after he betrays his partner Partridge (Sean Bean) who he discovered with a book. Now, as his memories come back and emotions emerge, he must keep his emotions in tact while attempting to help the rebels and stay one step ahead of his eager young partner Brandt (Taye Diggs) a soldier almost equal in skill and abilities who is anxious to discover his secret and further his own career. The soldiers sit in a stadium where they're fed messages from the high father who watches over Libria, and everyone is monitored for emotions ala ""1984."" Those found with contraband including books, records, literature or art are killed and then the contraband is properly burned ala ""Farenheit 451"". It's obvious by looking at the facility that the government doesn't have much faith in their process as they watch everyone, including their best soldier Preston. He himself is plagued with traces of emotions and his haunting memory of selling his wife out to the authorities causing her death all the while hiding his emotions from his colleagues and his young son who is also being tailored as a clerick and watches him like a hawk as well. Christian Bale portrays a warrior without emotion, a warrior who kills without mercy and then must slowly progress into a man who's emotions are slowly coming back to him and express his realization towards those emotions, and Bale handles it with impressive range and incredible depth. Diggs play well against Preston as his rival constantly monitoring him and attempting to outdo him while Preston must stay one step ahead of him in his struggle with his emotions. There are many memorable scenes in the film, some utterly fantastic, and some fantastic for being so simple. Wimmer, obviously a martial arts movie buff creates some incredible and stylistic action sequences with the help of"
264,PYK_Doc4_Equilibrium,PYK_Doc4_Equilibrium,PYK,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium,"Pilfered though it is from many superior (and not-so-superior) sources, Equilibrium has a lot more to offer than you'd expect. Dimension Films (the genre branch of Miramax) sat on it for over a year before finally dumping it into a paltry 301 screens in a December death slot against the big year-end films (i.e., The Two Towers and its like). It didn't even get a chance to make back its relatively low $20 million budget  it grossed just over $1 million before disappearing from theaters in three weeks. The movie deserves far better. Equilibrium is not the most original movie to come down the pike  it's indebted to your choice of dystopian science fiction (1984, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, The Matrix, Gattaca)  but it's a sleek and forceful film of its kind, with some of the most eye-boggling gunfight scenes in recent memory. They're not even gunfights  they're more like systematic gun massacres, begun and finished in an eyeblink, with shooter and targets close enough to kiss. John Preston (Christian Bale), a ""Grammaton Cleric"" (i.e., assassin for the government), does far more shooting than kissing. John is one of the black-clad enforcers of the new world order: in the post-WWIII fascist state of Libria, it has been determined that war and violence can be blamed solely on emotion, so all emotions have been outlawed. Scruffy bands of resistance fighters, who have refused to take their daily dose of the emotion-killing drug Prozium, gather together to appreciate art, music, film  contraband works of beauty (which are illegal because they inspire feeling). John is a complete moral and emotional blank, which means he's the best at his job, and his two children, raised (like him) on a steady diet of Prozium, are likewise empty. John was married once, but his wife became a ""sense offender,"" rebelling against the emotionless world, and was summarily executed while John stood nearby, not bothered in the slightest. Such a man could never carry a movie if there weren't a change of heart  or, in John's case, an introduction of heart  in store for him. Christian Bale plays the early scenes almost as a sequel to his dead-zone Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, as if Bateman had finally found his niche as a callous destroyer in the bleak world of Libria and was handed a badge and a gun. But little by little, emotion invades his shell. His partner Partridge (Sean Bean) succumbs to the poetry of Yeats; John neutrally pulls Partridge's plug, but with the tiniest flicker of doubt (""I'll do what I can to see that they go easy on you,"" he says, an odd sentiment for someone supposedly without sentiment). Later, John drops one of his Prozium capsules, but instead of getting a replacement, he begins to have feelings. Some viewers may complain that John, conveniently for the plot, has an emotionally tough day ahead of him the same morning he goes Prozium-free; but he may"
265,PYK_Doc5_Equilibrium,PYK_Doc5_Equilibrium,PYK,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium,"""Equilibrium"" would be a mindless action picture, except that it has a mind. It doesn't do a lot of deep thinking, but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x, it does make a statement: Freedom of opinion is a threat to totalitarian systems. Dictatorships of both the left and right are frightened by the idea of their citizens thinking too much, or having too much fun. The movie deals with this notion in the most effective way, by burying it in the story and almost drowning it with entertainment. In a free society many, maybe most, audience members will hardly notice the message. But there are nations and religions that would find this movie dangerous. You know who you are. The movie is set in the 21st centuryhey! that's our century!at a time after the Third World War. That war was caused, it is believed, because citizens felt too much and too deeply. They got all worked up and started bombing each other. To assure world peace and the survival of the human race, everyone has been put on obligatory doses of Prozium, a drug that dampens the emotions and shuts down our sensual side. (Hint: The working title of this movie was ""Librium."") In the movie, enforcers known as Clerics have the mandate to murder those who are considered Sense Offenders. This is a rich irony, since True Believers, not Free Thinkers, are the ones eager to go to war over their beliefs. If you believe you have the right to kill someone because of your theology, you are going about God's work in your way, not His. Christian Bale stars in ""Equilibrium,"" as Cleric John Preston, partnered with Partridge (Sean Bean) as a top-level enforcer. Nobody can look dispassionate in the face of outrageous provocation better than Bale, and he proves it here after his own wife is incinerated for Sense Offenses. ""What did you feel?"" he is asked. ""I didn't feel anything,"" he replies, and we believe him, although perhaps this provides a clue about his wife's need to Offend. Preston is a top operative, but is hiding something. We see him pocketing a book that turns out to be the collected poetry of W.B. Yeats, a notorious Sense Offender. He has kept it, he explains, to better understand the enemy (the same reason censors have historically needed to study pornography). His duties bring him into contact with Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson), and he feelswell, it doesn't matter what he feels. To feel at all is the offense. Knowing that, but remembering Mary, he deliberately stops taking his Prozium: He loves being a Cleric, but, oh, you id. If ""Equilibrium"" has a plot borrowed from 1984, Brave New World and other dystopian novels, it has gunfights and martial arts borrowed from the latest advances in special effects. More rounds of ammunition are expended in this film than in any film I can remember, and I remember ""The Transporter."" I learn from Nick Nunziata at CHUD.com that"
266,PYK_Doc6_Equilibrium,PYK_Doc6_Equilibrium,PYK,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium,"A tedious rip-off sci-fi film, itching to be another Matrix (or, maybe just a bearable flick!), that brazenly steals everything from Orwell's 1984 novel and many other thinking man's films, with the same Dystopian agenda, such as Fahrenheit 451. It offers for the viewers of the more low rent sci-fi films the required martial-arts fight sequences and plenty of metallic techno gadgetry; and, it appeals to a more arty audience by its cleverly created totalitarian gothic set design of mixing actual Berlin locations with CGI effects. Nevertheless, it fails overall to arouse interest dramatically, conceptually or inventively. I've seen this film's theme played out too often (and in a more spirited way) in recent films to find its well-intentioned virtues necessarily welcome or pleasing. It only adds unneeded celluloid to an increasingly tired genre! Director-writer Kurt Wimmer (1995-""One Man's Justice""), a screenwriter for such films as the 1998-""Sphere,"" the 1999-""The Thomas Crown Affair"" and the 2003-""The Recruit,"" never got this 'baby' off the ground. The banal dialogue was risible (a prime example has the humanist heroine played by Emily Watson in all seriousness state: ""Without love, breath is just a clock ticking""), the main action hero, Christian Bale, was miscast. His stiff actions were too self-conscious and deliberate to fill the role of an action hero. The bleak settings were uninspiring; the overall grey effect was more stunting than enlightening. What becomes most annoying is that it strings together a bunch of cliches from just about every sci-fi film and the melodrama never becomes anything more than a silly exercise in acting silly. It's a film that, quite frankly, offers little entertainment value or much of anything else (it even fails to answer most of the challenging questions it raises about state-controlled suppression). Equilibrium takes place in a futuristic world in the 21st-century post-WWIII. It resembles a fascist state where books are burned and no emotions are allowed in the belief this will prevent an uprising and another world war. John Preston (Christian Bale) is the highest ranking Grammaton ninjalike cleric in Libria, where he's a police enforcer (using a new fight technique called ""Gun-Kata"") going on missions to root out all rebels who haven't taken their required daily dose of the emotion suppressing Prozium; and, he's also around to rid the world of literature, art and sentimental relics of the past. Preston catches cleric partner Partridge (Sean Bean) sneaking off with a book of poetry by WB Yeats, and turns him over to the state authorities. Partridge's expected fate is as doomed as Preston's wife, who was executed for Sense Offences (leaving him a widower with two children, one of them training in the monastery to be a cleric). But the tricky Partridge before he departs this dystopia, tells his robotic partner ""I spread my dreams under your feet."" Before you can say 'let's burn some more books' all of the following things happen to Preston: he's given a new uptight cleric partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs), who may be"

Here's a true story: This evening, I went to see a movie called ""Equilibrium."" Now normally, I save every movie ticket and throw them in a shoebox filled with precious mementos. On my trip through the parking lot, I pulled out my Zippo and proceeded to burn it. Then proceeded to speed home, so I could take an extremely violent crap. I don't know what was worse; how painful the bowel movement was, or how painful the movie was. Roger Ebert gave this movie 3 stars out of 4. As soon as I'm done writing this review, I'm going to track him down and force-feed him his review. Laced with Strychnine. I realize you're probably thinking, ""Shouldn't the punishment fit the crime?"" But frankly, I'm a busy man, and I don't have time for 6 months of chakra torture. I suppose you're expecting some sort of review of the movie, so I guess I should make an attempt. Then again, if I put as much effort into this review as writer/director Kurt Wimmer put into his screenplay, I could call it a day right now. ""Equilibrium"" gives us a society, Libria, which is opiated by a drug known as Librium, a necessity after World War III. The survivors in power decided that it was man's emotion that led to war, and in order to prevent any such future occurrences, they constructed a society based on emotionless. This is aided by the destruction of all art, music, and cultural relics, not to mention 3 doses a day of the aforementioned Librium injection. Those who forsake the drug are known as ""Sense Offenders,"" and these criminals are tended to by an elite class of soldiers known as Clericks. And by ""tended to,"" I mean ""Terminated with extreme prejudice."" Within the first 20 minutes of the film, we've encountered Clerick John Preston, watched him kill his partner for being a sense offender, and discovered his wife was executed for Sense offenses 4 years earlier. But thanks to his Librium doses, he doesn't seem to mind much. Watching this movie, I suddenly wished they made a drug which made horrible movies good. All is well and good in emotionless Libria, until Preston accidentally knocks a vial of his Librium off the bathroom sink, and doesn't have time to pick up another dose. Suddenly, he is overwhelmed with emotion, and continues to abstain from his medication, leading him to question authority and rebel. And by ""rebel,"" I mean ""Terminate with extreme prejudice."" I suppose you're expecting me to say something along the lines of, ""At this point, the movie degenerates into a Matrix-wannabe."" Unfortunately, the movie was that from the moment Preston and his partner show up to tend to the first lot of sense offenders. Christian Bale was dripping with Keanuosity, from the slicked-back black hair, black garb, and generally emotionless acting ability. Although one would"

One element goes wrong, and the work of many people could be negated. This is why I don't usually geIt angry when I see bad movies. Somebody tries to the best of their abilities with the budget they have and brings a project to a completion. That's respectable. But this lazy Matrix wannabe with bad CGI, the incredibly childish ""gun katta"" fighting, and a ridiculous premise makes me angry and sad that Sean Bean and Christian Bale took their time to star in this, when they could've been making better movies. These kinds of cash-grabs do make me angry. But at least such movies usually get panned by the public and we never hear anything about them ever again. The fact that this thing received positive reviews from the public made me think that either I saw a different film than everybody else or this world needs to be set on fire, along with the modern film industry, if this kind of garbage is going to be an acceptable standard for entertainment from now on. Let us start with the plot: in the future feelings are illegal. ....................... Turn this s**t off right now. You can just turn it off right there. What else do you need to know? How can anyone in their right mind still proceed to watch something when the main idea is so insultingly stupid? How can you believe a single thing shown on the screen with that as the back story? Here is a better premise I just came up with: in the future people only have one leg and must touch a pickle every 24 hours with their left index finger so that Hollywood executives can keep getting paid for artistically bankrupt content. Who keeps coming up with this stuff? Does someone get paid for it? Can I join in on the scam? If you manage to get past this, then what you get is a cheap looking Matrix rip-off, mostly a stylistic rip-off but the story is not that different either if you think about it. The protagonists are wearing jackets they fished out of the bin outside of the Matrix Reloaded studio and are carrying Desert Eagles as their weapons of choice - you know, those giant pistols you see in Pamela Anderson's productions and other 90's direct-to-video action movies showing up on your TV at 1AM in the morning. I bet the actors were happy with that stupid premise though, because it means they can all be emotionless, you know, because that is why they get paid large amounts of money, to look like a wooden plank with guns attached.

What a waste of $5.75 and 107 minutes of my life that I will never get back. I'm sorry but whomever tries to praise this movie obviously has very little knowledge of film or is so brain dead and numbed by ""cool guns"" that they actually think this movie is remotely good. As soon as Sean Bean died this movie just went downhill. I honestly feel sorry that so many talented actors were suckered into starring in the next Robot Jox. It's not hard being wooden as an actor and I do have respect for Bale, but this dead-pan ""anti-emotion"" thing just wasn't happening with me. The plot is a rehashed cheese 1984 meets Darkman. Talk about bad. I won't knock Weimer though. This was his first film and I can only hope that this movie was severely edited or had lots of script changes due to budget constraints and production house pressures. Maybe he took it upon himself to take credit (or more like blame) for the writing. Some films that were supposed to be excellent have been hampered by studio interference. Maybe Weimer wasn't big on standing up to the production house or maybe, just maybe, his direction and writing really is that bad. Though I certainly hope that I am wrong about the latter statement. Alien 3 is a good example of a noble idea being tarnished by the production company. A good director (David Fincher) who was so disappointed with the studio control that he walked out on it! Did Weimer do the same thing? I hope there was at least some dissent between his ""idea"" and Dimension Films'. Hopefully he will do better the next time around but, then again, some directors never learn from their mistakes. Stuart Baird is a good example. Speaking of which, this and Star Trek Nemesis rank among the lamest Sci-Fi films I have seen in recent times. A film that's supposed to be Sci-Fi has to at least be interesting. Sure the Matrix has ripped off other films but this one is so blatant and so badly completed that it doesn't deserve any good review in it's present state. The Action scenes are pretty weak for 20 million. If you want to see how a good low-budget action film is made check out El Mariachi. I believe it was done on a budget of about $7,000. Legions beyond this. Again, I don't want to rip into Weimer but I have to say that if his next film is as bad as this one, then I'll know that the reason Equilbrium was such a poor film was because of the direction. There's a good reason that this film was in limited release. IT SUCKED!"

Emotional intelligence score: 14 years old (male). Unsurprisingly, since music IS emotion, the soundtrack is glaringly bad: emotionally-inappropriate, plain awful scores, cringe-worthy especially during dramatic fight scenes, worsen by amateur audio mixing and compression. I like dramatic neoclassical-electro-pop, a la Batman or Blade Runner, not shallow grandeur electro-melodramatica that drown out dialog and smother to death the rare signs of authentic human emotions. The visual effect is either very good or exceptionally bad. Cinematic composition and especially close-ups and indoor scenes are very well done and original in visualization, given the relatively low budget. CGIs of city long shots and animations are simply pre-2000, full of glaring errors, even typical machinima cut scenes will fetch greater realism... Casting choices highly inconsistent. Christian Bale is in a lonely class of his own. Sean Bean and William Fichner were underused. Emily Watson is supposed to represent emotion, but her botox-frozen eyes and stiff too-groomed-for-prison lips failed to convey sorrow or fear. Dupont the leader is badly cast (or directed), no muscle tone no authority no weighty dramatic presence - a mere annoying chubby puppy barking unintelligibly at the sharp impeccable Christian Bale. At his most threatening moments, Dupont manages to act the soft flabby-cheek lawyer mumbling some pretentious overly-wordy threats. His idea of conveying authority is throwing a lame saliva-flying table-banging temper tantrum. Which brings us to... THE MEANING OF EMOTION (according to Kurt Wimmer) Apparently there're only a few women left in the city. But of course - the convention is women are ""emotional"", men are...cool? In the brave new world of mid 21st century, it seems women will still being scapegoated as ""the more emotional"" sex, because they just like to hoard pretty antique stuff so they will more likely to be exterminated. Most men are less into frilly stuff, so they will obediently inject themselves with emotional botox and go around efficiently killing those unrepentant feminine-minded music-appreciating losers who hoard books and vinyls. Yep... The writer director failed to understand entry-level human psychology vocab: Emotions and feelings, technically, aren't the same. Sensation is an even more distinct thing. To Kurt Wimmer, emotions, feelings, sensations mean the same thing - BUT - anger, paranoia, fear, competitiveness, domineering and controlling impulse, killing thirst, are not emotions or feelings. So what is feelings to Kurt? SENTIMENT. Sentimental attachment to family photos, little personal objects, art, domesticated animals, paintings. Yep...you know, chick stuff. HATRED (of anything including people with unacceptable behaviors) are apparently not an emotion, nor war-inducing, by the law of Equilibrium society. THE NEED TO KILL OFF A PERCEIVED THREAT (a.k.a. paranoia) is apparently not an emotion also. Equilibrium's masters, including the protagonist, are THAT stupid. This is a classic case of the typical aggressive males feeling shame for feeling anything at all - hence failing to classify their own most frequent emotional experience as emotions. No wonder"

It's a murder charge in which the deed has yet to be committed. Due to the discovery of the Precogs, three humans with the special ability to predict unlawful activities approximately four days in advance of their occurrences, the crime rate has dropped by over 90% in the area. Anderton specializes in ""red ball"" situations (designated by an elaborate computer system synced to the Precogs brains that spits out colored wooden orbs), such as 1108, which are crimes of passion  since there's no premeditation, these murders can only be seen a few hours or minutes prior to the event. This new scheme is the ultimate invasion of privacy  and it's on the verge of sweeping the nation. Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is sent from the Attorney General of the United States to determine if there are any flaws in the system before the program spreads to other districts. Since humans run it, there will be inevitable glitches. The first problem occurs when John digs around the archives looking for a specific murder case in which the killer was apprehended but never identified. Each case is supposed to have three previsions, one from each Precog  the most powerful auger being the catatonic Agatha (Samantha Morton). But several of Agatha's files are missing. The following day, the divine trio have another visual prophecy  one in which Anderton himself is the murderer. In the future, automated eye scan devices identify everyone so that movements across the city cannot occur without government knowledge. It's a scarily authoritarian arrangement designed to demonstrate the oppression and faults of a Big Brother world. And it's just a piece of a rather impressive conceptualization of the dictatorial, slave-to-technology years to come, mixed with darker, noirish elements of grime and shadows (like an updated ""Blade Runner"" setting). Other visual accessories and indications of scientific advancements include an innovative, computerized workspace (in which files float across translucent screens  an idea frequently spoofed and copied), high-speed cars that move up and down skyscrapers, three-dimensional memory files, and rickety jetpacks. Additionally, Paul Verhoeven-styled, commercial-like news updates and invasive media is blasted through enormous monitors stationed throughout the city. As an action picture more predominantly than a thinking man's piece, the stunts and chases are nicely choreographed, further embellished with fitting music by John Williams. It's a light-hearted type of violent adventure along the lines of a futuristic Indiana Jones (or any of Schwarzenegger's sci-fi works), with cleverer escapes and showdowns, and subtle humor fused into the combat. The level of fantasy frequently rivals the severer science-fiction elements, radiating Spielberg's brand of lively storytelling.

For a rock-solid two hours, the director of some of cinema's biggest masterpieces sends us headfirst into a nightmarish, unforgettable landscape that is clotted by elaborate technology, cutting edge law enforcement, elite government officials and fragmented personal identities. During that space of time, there is even a point when we ask ourselves if Spielberg has finally mastered a genre that he has so often tested himself in over the years (first with ""E.T. - The Extra Terrestrial"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" later with ""A.I. - Artificial Intelligence""). Those hopes, unfortunately, are blind-sighted when the film takes its last steps onto a familiar piece of moviemaking ground, which insists that completely explained endings in science fiction are better suited for audiences than ones which leave a lot of the details up to speculation. Literal translation: the filmmakers can't trust an audience with evidence, even when there's enough of it to support their own individual interpretations. Forgive me if this makes the movie sound a lot worse than it actually is, because once this rather diminutive detail is stripped away from the result, ""Minority Report"" is quite an extraordinary experience. Even more of an achievement than his highly stylized efforts with ""A.I."", Spielberg's latest undertaking is a swift, intelligent, relentless, creative, and compelling outing down to the very finest details. The premise is based primarily on a famous short story by Philip K. Dick, who inspired the stories for ""Blade Runner"" and ""Total Recall,"" and in that regard the movie has the genuine psychological depth and irony seen in those past endeavors. But this isn't simply a futuristic tale with neat little gadgets and gizmos stood up against a penetrating narrative. Spielberg's vision brings a frightening and seemingly outreached realism to his subject matter, pulverizing boundaries between life and illusion so expertly that even potentially ridiculous visual gimmicks, such as scurrying mechanical spiders, come off as authentic. The screenplay by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen is a sea of fresh ideas and approaches, expertly crafted not just to keep the audience engaged, but to nourish their senses in the process. The fundamentals of Dick's mesmerizing short story are likewise matched with elaborate and believable plot setups, which build to pulse-pounding heights at some points (as when Anderton resorts to having his eyes changed by a former adversary to prevent identification to authorities) and then sink into pleasing subtlety at others (such as a scene in which Agatha, the center of the Pre-Cog unit, reflects on what life would have been like had Anderton not lost his only young son). Though the story is always busy hurrying around for the next necessary device, it's worth noting that the pacing is rock-solid, especially considering that the picture's 140-minute running"
273,RPN_Doc3_Minority_Report,RPN_Doc3_Minority_Report,RPN,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority_Report,"In the satirically detailed world of Minority Report, which unfolds in 2054, you can't walk into a Gap store without a hologram greeting you by name and complimenting you on the last item you bought there  perhaps you'd care for a black tank-top? Privacy is dead, and people visit a virtual-reality club to explore their wildest fantasies; one man wants to kill his boss, but knows that if he plans to do it for real, Washington's Pre-Crime unit will catch him before he carries it out. Experience seems to be dead, too. The population is safe from certain forms of physical aggression, but they've all been pre-emptively neutered, like Alex in A Clockwork Orange. I refer to that Stanley Kubrick classic for a reason: Minority Report, despite some eleventh-hour lapses and rhetorical flab, is the movie A.I. should have been. Steven Spielberg, adapting Kubrick's long-cherished project last year, missed the mark so completely that the result offered the best of neither director. But Minority Report is the real thing, more Kubrick than anything Spielberg has done, and more Spielberg than anything Spielberg has done in too many years. I had given up hope, fearing Spielberg to be lost in his warm bubble bath of homilies: His recent movies haven't been entertaining or even educational  they've been instructional. Well, Spielberg seems to have snapped out of it. He is working once again with his trademark effortless sense of purpose and precision. If his previous recent films have been tepid baths, this one is a cold shower  shocking and revivifying. Tom Cruise is John Anderton, ace ""detective"" for the Pre-Crime unit. Spielberg's and Cruise's first collaboration has not produced the expected smiling, cocky, full-blooded hero, but rather an angry, hollow, flawed man, who takes drugs to kill his torment over his kidnapped little boy. Anderton is thus driven to stop crimes before they happen, though his logic is faulty, since a boy can be kidnapped and tortured for years without being ""seen"" by Pre-Crime's three precognitives, who can only see future murders. Cruise plays Anderton as a man who throws all his faith into the ""perfect"" Pre-Crime structure because if it is shown to be faulty, his work  his reason for not eating his gun  is rendered meaningless. Faulty it is, though. The ""Pre-Cogs""  cleverly named Agatha, Arthur and Dashiell  ""see"" Anderton killing someone within 36 hours, a man he's never met. The full weight of the Pre-Crime force  led by Max von Sydow as its figurehead and Colin Farrell as a sort of internal-affairs investigator looking for flaws in the system  comes down on Anderton, who flees into the city. It's there that Minority Report most closely resembles a previous bitter dystopian drama inspired, like this one, by a Philip K. Dick story: Blade Runner, in which Harrison Ford bumped up against a menagerie of colorful characters. Here, Anderton meets a crackpot who traffics in black-market eyes (Peter Stormare), a virtual-reality pimp"
274,RPN_Doc4_Minority_Report,RPN_Doc4_Minority_Report,RPN,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority_Report,"Set in the year 2054, Steven Spielberg's Minority Report looks clammy and bleached-out. The oppressiveness, of course, is intentional, but is it necessary? High-concept science-fiction escapades often try to impose new ways of seeing, but Spielberg seems intent on blistering our optic nerves. Like A.I., Minority Report is a movie in furious conflict with itself. Hope is pitted, rather unsuccessfully, against dystopia -- or is it dyspepsia? The result is one of the glummest and most forbidding thrillers ever. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, who runs the Justice Department's Precrime unit, which acts on evidence provided by three human ""Pre-cogs"" who float in a liquid suspension chamber and can see visions of future murders. The images they transmit are displayed in haphazard fragments on a giant screen before which Anderton stands like a maestro, sorting out the pictures with sweeping waves of his arms. The garish, fractured visuals may cause some in the audience to experience deja vu: Can it be that the Pre-cogs are channeling the credit sequence from Seven? What really spooks him, as in A.I., is that it may no longer be possible to be truly human in such a cyberfuture. Anderton, in addition to his Precrime problems, is also aggrieved by the unsolved kidnapping six years ago of his son. He compulsively plays back holographic home movies of his boy and has a drug habit. All this is meant to humanize Anderton for us, but Tom Cruise doesn't really have much inner life as an actor, and so the effect is muddled. Anderton is supposed to be running away from himself, from his demons, but that's not what comes across. He's running to get away. Cruise has become such a movie-star icon that we're supposed to gasp in awe whenever he gets down and dirty and messes with his iconography. In what amounted to a ghastly piece of reverse narcissism in Vanilla Sky, he spent half the movie sporting a surgically distended face. (It's as if he were saying, ""Look how ugly I make myself and still you watch me."") In Minority Report, he's such a dynamo that he converts even the process of grieving into a form of aerobics. Cruise carries the movie, but I was relieved to turn to some of the other players, including Colin Farrell as Anderton's nemesis, and Samantha Morton as the most gifted of the Pre-cogs, for more evocative human shadings. Spielberg is still in his Kubrick mode in Minority Report, which is to say that, even more than in A.I., he has split himself off from the verve and emotional sympathy that characterize his best films. I respect his desire to challenge himself and go deeper and darker. It's just that most of what's dark about Minority Report is basically futuro film noir, and what's ""deep"" about it are the standard sci-fi tropes about the individual vs. society and what's real and what isn't, as well as the usual quasi-religious overtones about playing God. Ultimately, the film turns into"
275,RPN_Doc5_Minority_Report,RPN_Doc5_Minority_Report,RPN,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority_Report,"Once again this year we are graced with a futuristic sci-fi flick based on a short story by the visionary Philip Dick, this time in the form of ""Minority Report"", which poses the intriguing hypothesis: What if we could see into the future and arrest people before they commit a murder, or any other crime for that matter? Set in the year 2054 in Washington, D.C., Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, who, having lost his son, now does his best to prevent murders before they happen as Chief of the elite Pre-Crime Division of the Justice Department. Assisting him are three genetically altered precognitives known as ""Pre-Cogs"" who are attached to machines that record their visions of murders which are ""set"" to occur anywhere from a few minutes to four days into the future. With each vision, two wooden balls roll out of the machine attachment, each one bearing the name of the killer and victim. As a result of this ""perfect"" system, Washington, D.C. is now murder free. (Let's face it, given our life and times, Dick should have set this scenario in 3054 to have any plausibility.) Believing the Pre-Cogs infallible, Anderton advocates nationalizing the Pre-Crime system, that is until the Justice Department questions the methods and techniques utilized by the Division and Anderton himself becomes the subject of a Pre-Cog vision seeing him committing a murder. Suddenly questioning the accuracy of the system (since he of course knows he's innocent and will continue to be innocent), Anderton goes on the run, stealing a female Pre-Cog named Agatha, setting us up for what now becomes a routine futuristic chase movie. Directed by Steven Spielberg, ""Minority Report"" reeks of the darker tone and color desaturation found in Spielberg's last futuristic foray, ""A.I."", a technique that works well in this type of film and once again is executed beautifully by long time Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. Hand in hand with Kaminski's artistic flair, are some dazzling special effects action sequences, including a chase on a vertical highway that is so impressive, you have to see it to believe it. (Warning  those with severe motion sickness may want to cover their eyes at this part.) Not to be outdone, many scenes which one would believe are special effects, are in fact, the result of elaborately and elegantly choreographed camera maneuvers which are expertly executed and utilized for maximum dramatic effect. Cruise performs admirably as Anderton, using physicality and controlled raw emotion to their best advantage as he manipulates not only his pursuers, but the audience as well. An excellent counterpoint to Cruise's energetic yet psychologically tormented Anderton is Samantha's Moore portrayal of Pre-Cog Agatha  tacit, ethereal and seemingly helpless. Max von Sydow, no stranger to the futuristic and fantastic (""Dune"", ""Judge Dredd"" and ""The Exorcist"") steps in as Anderton's superior, Bureau Director Burgess, exhibiting an almost fatherly pride in his protege Anderton while relative newcomer, Colin Farrell is perfectly cast as the bureaucratic FBI investigator Danny Witwer who"
276,RPN_Doc6_Minority_Report,RPN_Doc6_Minority_Report,RPN,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority_Report,"Minority Report is the latest film directed by Steven Spielberg. In the year 2054 murder has been eliminated in Washington DC through the use of a team of psychics who infallibly foresee killings. The would-be murderers are apprehended before they commit their crimes and sent to cryogenic freezing units. When the leading figure in the ""Pre-Crime Unit,"" John Anderton (Tom Cruise), is named as the future killer of a man he does not know, he sets out to unravel the mystery, with his own police force hot on his trail. Anderton's own son was abducted and presumably murdered some years before, an event that also shattered his marriage. Spielberg is one of the more gifted members of a generation of studio filmmakers whose output in general has been exceedingly poor and forgettable. He has the undoubted ability to narrate a drama effectively, to hold the spectator's attention and to develop a theme. His themes, however, tend to revolve around the concerns of his generation of upper middle class Americans. It is surely notable that in a filmmaking career spanning thirty tumultuous years, Spielberg, whose personal wealth reportedly exceeds $2 billion, has not once weighed in tellingly on the state of American society. Minority Report, based on a 1956 short story by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, has intriguing and entertaining elements. No expense has been spared. The filmmakers have thought up all manner of ingenious devices, combining the retrograde and the futuristic, to create the world of 2054. However, as is nearly always the case in contemporary science fiction, the imagination has only been set to work on ""things,"" not relations between people, not social life. There are absurdities in Minority Report which reveal a great deal about the social assumptions and prejudices of its creators. The American society of half a century from now is presented as generally prosperous and content, insofar as one is able to determine, but crime and murder (and drug use) persist. Why? Is there no connection between poverty and violent behavior, or, more generally, between social reality and crime? The filmmakers are either adapting to themselves to the right-wing argument that crime is essentially causeless (rooted in Man's fallen state) or, probably more to the point, indicating their lack of interest in its causes and a concern merely with the means of avoiding its consequences. The discovery that the psychics do not always agree, that there are suppressed ""minority reports,"" suggesting other possible outcomes, is the turning point in Spielberg's film. The Pre-Crime Unit may, in fact, be seizing and incarcerating those who were never going to commit any offenses. Anderton finds out for himself the complex relationship between the apparently inevitable and the actual manner in which events play themselves out. This is not to say that the film offers no critique of the future world, or by implication, the present one. Spielberg is not a fool, nor simply a propagandist for the existing state of things.

Dick, plays for most of its running time like a John Ashcroft wet dream, but in the last minutes it chickens out with an American Civil Liberties Union-approved ending full of pardons and second thoughts. Tom Cruise gives one of his most inconsistent and incoherent performances as Chief John Anderton of the elite Department of Pre-Crime in Washington, D.C., circa 2054. Just think of it: Murder has been banished from the nation's capital because the guilty are punished before their crimes are committed. At one time or another, Anderton is a bereaved father sobbing over his murdered child and a Toscanini of mumbo-jumbo hand gestures summoning future crime to virtual reality and then apprehending and imprisoning the criminals before they have committed the crimes. Then, lest the kids begin yawning during the tediously expository dialogue, Anderton turns into a superspeedy fugitive from justice outrunning, outwitting and outmuscling a horde of Pre-Crime troopers in the silliest chase scenes in movie history. Colleagues I respect and even admire have written rave reviews for Minority Report . My own minority report is that it stinks, and I would leave it at that if it were not for my embarrassing admiration for Mr. Spielberg's A.I.: Artificial Intelligence last year. ""Embarrassing"" only because I'm supposed to be a registered auteurist from way back. It is not that I am particularly disappointed in Mr. Spielberg for making Minority Report . I have been considerably less than enthralled by most of his films over the years, and yet I have always understood why mine was often a minority position on his career. Lately, some critics have been condescendingly describing him as a Kubrick without cojones , which is to overlook Kubrick's frequent descents into sentimentality and infantilism, however diluted with vinegar. At their best, though not necessarily most popular, both directors-Kubrick with The Shining (1980) and the first part of Full Metal Jacket (1987), Mr. Spielberg with Empire of the Sun (1987) and A.I. (2001)-have displayed an ability to confound their juvenile constituency with an expression of psychological maturity. By contrast, Minority Report sinks to the level of pornographically violent video games such as Grand Theft Auto, with some ghoulish surgery involving switched eyeballs guaranteed to titillate the tots. Indeed, the film's vaunted Pre-Crime technology ends up looking like little more than a peculiarly shaped pinball machine. The incongruities of mixing futuristic environments with defiantly retro costuming are supposed to be amusing. In this respect, the curious publicity campaign to promote Irish Russell Crowe-like rogue actor Colin Farrell as the new Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt heartthrob is sabotaged by the sanitized, American-accented version of Mr. Farrell in a vintage F.B.I. business suit circa 1950. I won't go into the holes in the plot, because Swiss-cheese narratives are supposedly part of the postmodern idiom, but I did wonder idly why Anderton seemed to lose interest"
278,RPN_Doc8_Minority_Report,RPN_Doc8_Minority_Report,RPN,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority_Report,"What new hell is this? In the shallow, noisy and pretentious Minority Report , we have seen the future. It's not pretty. There are two Steven Spielbergs. One is the cinematic historian who instructs, informs and shapes a universal consciousness that makes us aware of our stake in the human race in masterpieces like Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan . The other is a 12-year-old comic-book collector weaned on sci-fi and stuck in the twilight zone of his own nursery, who turns out polished but moronic time-wasters about dinosaurs, space ships, Indiana Jones and Peter Pan. Quel doppelganger . I always have a hard time believing the same man capable of both greatness ( The Color Purple ) and trash ( Jurassic Park ). Occasionally, a film like E.T. or Raiders of the Lost Ark emerges to meld the technical proficiency of the craftsman with the passion of the storyteller. Bloody, violent, cold and preposterous, Minority Report is not one of them. Despite an astronomical budget and a gallimaufry of twists and turns enhanced by special effects, Minority Report has a boring, one-dimensional story line you could write on one page of Big Chief tablet paper with a No. 2 lead pencil. Derived from a story by sci-fi spinmaster Philip K. Dick (the man responsible for Blade Runner ), it's set in Washington, D.C., in 2054. Crime has been wiped out thanks to an experimental Pre-Crime Unit called a ""priori,"" developed by wacko scientist Max von Sydow, that can predict murders before they happen. Tom Cruise plays Detective John Anderton, the futuristic cop in charge of preventing homicides with the aid of three psychic visionaries called ""Pre-Cogs"" who float around in a liquid wading pool wired, drugged and having nightmares. Waving his arms like Leonard Bernstein in the orchestra pit, Anderton can download images of clues, suspects and crime scenes, then lead his futuristic crimebusters to the killers before they pull the trigger. With beady eyes, flexed jaw and a buzz cut, he's a man whose life is already so haunted by the abduction and murder of his only son that he looks and acts creepier than the Pre-Cogs. The world has apparently survived John Ashcroft, because the Justice Department thinks the Pre-Crime Unit is too controversial a concept to go national. In a subplot that goes nowhere, Irish hunk Colin Farrell is wasted as the dull F.B.I. investigator from the Attorney General's office who covets Anderton's job. The lulling narrative drones on until the tables turn and Anderton is named by the Pre-Cogs as the next murderer. From here, the movie turns from a whodunit into a who'll-do-it as the flawed hero (he's hooked on drugs) has 36 hours to solve his own case and clear his name by breaking into the Pre-Crime lab and downloading the info from the Pre-Cog who predicted it-and Mr. Spielberg sweats it all out, stretching the film's playing time to two hours plus.

I think the secret of Spielberg's success is that, unlike many other currently prominent directors, he is more able to balance the high-tech, effects-driven aspects of his movies with the much more important human factor. Although many of his most popular films have been effects extravaganzas like E.T., Close Encounters, and Jurassic Park, some of his best films are the ones where effects take a back seat to character and relationship work; i.e., Schindler's List, Amistad, Saving Private Ryan. Although Spielberg's latest effort, Minority Report, is admittedly one of his more emotionally sterile productions, it is not unlike last year's A.I. in that it features a fascinating, futuristic concept (based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, first published in Fantastic Universe magazine in 1956), with just enough of the human touch to make it emotionally accessible to the audience. While we may marvel at the ideas of crimes being predicted by psychic clairvoyants, or cars that glide effortlessly and automatically down the sides of skyscrapers and merge onto the highway with nary an accident, or advertisements that speak to you by name after having read your retinal scan, the issue more resonant to us is the man who has lost his little boy, and it is this issue that drives the film. Of course, it doesn't hurt to have reliable actors like Tom Cruise and Max von Sydow, not to mention a huge and uniformly capable supporting cast, and writers like Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, who adapted Dick's 50-year-old story for a current audience, or the tense and powerful music of Spielberg's longtime friend and composer, John Williams, to help with the overall effect. The story is set in Washington, D.C., in the year 2054. The city's law enforcement authorities have begun an experimental procedure for which they hope to seek acceptance (and funding) on a national level, called the PreCrime agency. Devised by retired law enforcement officer and elder statesman Lamar Burgess (von Sydow), the system uses the talents of three people with exceptional psychic abilities who are kept in a constant state of dream sleep by a combination of mind-numbing drugs, partial immersion in a huge sensory-deprivation tank, and electronic ""halos"" attached to their heads (which basically give them the Jack Nicholson treatment from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest). Using the fragmented images seen by these ""precognitives,"" which are projected onto a screen and interpreted by agents like Detective John Anderton (Cruise), the agency is able to predict and prevent every murder that is about to happen in the city, deftly stepping in and arresting the suspect before the crime has even been committed and fitting him with his own halo so he can enjoy the paralytic state that will keep him quiet while he rots in suspended-animation prison. Although this film is nearly 212 hours long (also like A.I.), it is almost constantly riveting, either from the standpoint"
280,RPN_Doc10_Minority_Report,RPN_Doc10_Minority_Report,RPN,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority_Report,"Steven Spielberg's Minority Report realizes the full potential of author Philip K. Dick's science-fiction worldview, a perspective filled with dangerous technology, feverish paranoia, and metaphysical philosophies. Spielberg's complicated, wonderfully stylized approach uses Dick's 1956 short story of the same name as a launching pad. While it captures the author's vision of an imperfect future and the perilous reality that dwells under the alluring surface of futurism, the picture also stands as Spielberg's most extraordinary exhibit of pure filmmaking. Minority Report augments and expands on the source material, concentrating Dick's obsessions about the potential dangers of technology and the author's ongoing existential battle between free will and determinism, especially in regard to the manipulation of time, such as time travel or precognition. Over more than forty novels and several short story collections, Dick's work permeates a sense of fascination and suspicion toward the future. The fascinating prospect of new technologies, exploration of new frontiers, and humanity's evolutionary progression of extra-sensory perceptions consume his output. And yet, he always investigates their inevitable downfalls. His stories feature characters hindered by supposed advancements, thrown into the central conflict by a set of circumstances put into motion by unsound developments. In that tradition, Spielberg's film is a nonstop chase, at once a thriller of epic escapist and intellectual bravado. It amalgamates Hitchcockian suspense, elements of film noir, and Dick's vision of the future, three of the most distinctive and inventive of all storytelling styles, into a single source, resulting in a masterful triumph from a masterful filmmaker. Established within these first scenes are all the elements of a wrong-man thriller, drawn from the institution of Alfred Hitchcock's cinema. Titles like The 39 Steps and Saboteur begin with the false charge of murder, the yarn unraveling as the protagonist does the impossible to prove their innocence. These are spellbinding stories that contain an immediate suspense given the nature of the plot. Spielberg takes every advantage of that, employing Hitchcockian tropes in the film's high-tech setting. While following Anderton's flight from justice, the director uses the chase to explore the film's ultramodern environment, showcasing a range of technology and equipment, but never slowing his pace to artificially linger on the background details more than the immediate wrong-man scenario. Minority Report's screenplay, written by Scott Frank and Jon Coen, scatters an array of multihued characters into the futuristic milieu, the most diverse of them appropriately being John Anderton. Peter Stomare plays a vengeful doctor with a nasty cold; Tim Blake Nelson is the Precrime prison's wheelchair-bound containment sentry; Daniel London as the clingy babysitter of the Precogs in their floating nutrient pool; Lois Smith is the pessimistic, sharp-witted mother of Precrime. Cruise, however, renders the performance of his career as Anderton. His intensity and dimensionality make the story not merely one of watching as special-effects instill marvel, but one fully grounded in the motivation of the character, the importance of the chase, the pain of his tragic background, and his pursuit of answers to a crucial mystery.

The film used some familiar approaches, but it also featured a good, creepy story and two very compelling characters. It was a wonderful horror picture and a surprise box office hit. With a modest $20 million budget the film managed to earn $320 million which pretty much guarantees a sequel in today's Hollywood. Now it is 2016, the horror genre is still pretty bland and stale, and along comes ""The Conjuring 2"" to give it another swift kick in the pants. James Wan returns to direct and co-write this second installment of the terrifying adventures of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. This time he is give $40 million and already the film seems on track to bring in a big return. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles as the Warrens this time six years after the events of the first film. It is 1976 and they are fresh off their most publicized case in Amityville, New York. During the encounter Lorraine experiences a horrifying vision which haunts her well after the case ends. Due to her fears the couple agree to step away from their supernatural investigations. One year later a single mother named Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) and her four children believe they are being haunted by a violent spirit in their London council house. The Catholic Church asks Ed and Lorraine to go to London to see if there is any validity to the claims. Upon arrival they find that the spirit seems to have targeted 11 year-old Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe). The Warrens witness a series of anomalies and must determine the true cause. The Warren characters we get may be fictionalized versions of the real people, but Wilson and Farmiga bring such personality to each. They still have the same wonderful chemistry and the script smartly manages to further explore their relationship through the events they are experiencing. Their mutual love and faithfulness is something refreshing and unique. I love these two characters and the two performances. A surprising amount of attention is given to the Hodgson family. Some may struggle with Wan's pacing, but he intentionally spends time developing their relationships, their social and economic struggles, and of course the frightening things that begin happening in their home. They are easy for us to care for. The writers simply don't allow them to be disposable characters. But first and foremost this is a horror movie and thankfully it is every bit as good as its predecessor. The film has its share of jump scares which Wan can build up to better than anyone. But he is more focused on the unsettling creepiness of what his audience sees. So many moments brim with tension simply based on the way Wan deliberately orchestrates the scene or moves his camera. And once again he doesn't have to rely on blood and gore despite the film's"

In fact, during the film's prologue, the Warrens appear at the Amityville house, where previous owners claimed a demonic presence drove them out. During a seance, Lorraine tries to make contact with whatever may be haunting the house, and she sees a horrific premonition. ""That's as close to Hell as I want to get,"" she tells her husband after coming out of her trance with a gut-wrenching scream. The audience can't help but react to several effective jolts and unsettling moments during this sequence, and the titles haven't even appeared onscreen yet. A masterful screw-turner, Wan's sequel to his 2013 hit The Conjuring doesn't dwell on the Amityville case, although what happens in Amityville doesn't stay in Amityville. As we learn, that case was contested in the media, while the Warrens' respected names were unduly tarnished. Wan and his three credited screenwriters use Amityville only for dramatic backstory, despite how the name alone could draw audiences. Indeed, the Amityville case hangs over the heads of our two investigators, once again played with warmth by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. And, along with the sequel's 133-minute runtime, the story's concern for characters over profits should tell you The Conjuring 2 is more than another cash grab like the 2014 prequel, Annabelle. Then again, they've injected gimmicks elsewhere to ensure the sequel performs just as well as the original (earning $137 million on a $20 million budget). Wan wants you to care about Ed and Lorraine Warren, and by choosing the suitable case through which these characters grow, he makes a better kind of exorcism film. After creating a wholly satisfying movie version of the Warrens' 1971 event at the Perron family home in Harrisville, Rhode Island, Wan's saga moves ahead to 1977. The location is Enfield, London, in a dilapidated council house that should be condemned. There, troubled single mother, Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor), looks over her four children, all of whom suffer from a presence in the housethe voice of an old man speaking from within the dark: ""This is my house,"" says the man in a gravelly voice. Peggy's stuttering, biscuit-obsessed youngest, Billy (Benjamin Haigh), is taunted by his toy firetruck, as well as his creepy zoetrope figure called ""Crooked Man"" and its accompanying song. But the poltergeist's main target is Peggy's middle daughter, Janet (Madison Wolfe), who becomes the spirit's plaything. After Amityville, Lorraine feels reluctant to accept another case. But Ed's good-hearted, helping nature convinces her, despite a warning from a particularly spooky demonic presence that has followed her since Amityville. So the Warrens head to London, conspicuously leaving their teenage daughter home alone during Christmastime, and team up with a resident skeptic (Franka Potente) and British paranormal researcher (Simon McBurney) to investigate the Hodgson home.

With an inexcusable 133-minute run time and a promise of more of the same, The Conjuring 2 wasn't high on my screening priority list  and yet I dug it more than I did the original. Sure, sure, it's impossible to believe that director-cowriter Wan and his team really mean for viewers to believe all this nonsense is based on fact, and, when all is said and done, it doesn't deviate in any discernible ways from the usual haunted-house yarns (in fact, parts of this one smack so much of Poltergeist that we almost expect to learn that an Indian burial ground is somehow involved). But it gets so much right that I'm willing to give it a generous thumbs-up in what's proving to be a particularly dismal movie season (the films featuring the heroic Avengers and the nice guys excepted). For one thing, stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson make a far greater connection as the real-life wife-and-husband team of paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren, here whisked off to England in 1977 to confirm the legitimacy of the haunting of a house occupied by single mom Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) and her four children. Farmiga and Wilson gave solid performances in the original, but they're even better here, primarily because their characters' love for, and devotion to, each other not only feels palpable but also plays directly into the narrative in interesting and surprising ways. Another strength is the principal setting of a North London council house, a nice change from the Amityville Lite stateside houses usually seen in contemporary thrillers of this ilk. What's more, Wan and production designer Julie Berghoff do a splendid job of capturing the dankness and decay of this sort of public housing prevalent at the time (and nice touch with the Starsky & Hutch posters in the two daughters' shared bedroom). As for the performers portraying the members of the tormented Hodgson family, it's 13-year-old Madison Wolfe who makes the strongest impression while tackling the largest role. As Janet, the demure daughter who's most affected by the supernatural shenanigans, she's excellent, often recalling the promise of the teenage Natalie Portman. (I assumed Wolfe was a British newcomer; imagine my surprise when I learned I had"

These two demonologists and agents of the Catholic Church found themselves attached to many supernatural casesincluding The Amityville Haunting, an event that made several headlines at the time and continues to live on in infamy in several feature films and TV movies. Critics of the Warrens decry their work as hoaxes, while many remain steadfast in their beliefs: the Devil is real, and demons walk among us. This time around, the Devil has taken two forms: Bill Wilkins (Bob Adrian), an old man who died in the house that the Hodgsons now reside in, and a Demonic Nun (Bonnie Aarons), who haunts both Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren. The Warrens are no stranger to demonic presences, but Lorraine had a premonition of Ed's death connected with the Nun and is positively spooked. The Conjuring 2, the follow-up to the massively successful$318 million from a $20 mil budgetand formally astute Conjuring from 2013, is based on The Enfield Poltergeist or, as the marketing material touts, ""the most documented case in paranormal history."" The matriarch of the family, Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor), is trying desperately to keep her head above financial waters, but her house is falling apart, her stuttering son (Benjamin Haigh) is being bullied at school, and her deadbeat husband left long ago, taking the records with him. Life isn't easy for Peggy, and her house is anything but warm and welcomingeven non-believers would deem it spookywhich makes her and her family an easy target for possession. As Ed tells her, the Devil likes to kick you when you're down. Ghost Wilkins spooks the family in the usual manner: noises, lights flickering, inanimate objects moving, TV trouble, etc. But when Ghost Wilkins takes possession of little Janet (Madison Wolfe), the Church calls the Warrens to investigate and possibly help. Lorraine hesitates, but Ed, ever the savior, answers the call to adventure and sticks both of them in harm's way. For The Conjuring 2, director James Wan retains his writing partners (Carey and Chad Hayes), production designer (Julie Berghoff), and editor (Kirk M. Morri) from the previous installment, continuing the best parts of the first movie. By adding cinematographer Don Burgesswhose constantly roving, swirling camera moves indiscriminately through solid objectsWan turns The Conjuring 2 into a visually inventive world with a lived-in feel. Though The Conjuring 2 has plenty of scares, it is hampered by a long and somewhat rambling setup. The first hour tries, somewhat unsuccessfully, to continue the Warrens' burden while setting up the Hodgsons' predicament. As Ghost Wilkins works his terror in London, the Warrens wonder about the mystery of the Demonic Nun in New England. As anyone watching may suspect, the two will come together in a spectacular payoff. They do, and when they do, it is quite something. A pity it took so long to get there. But pacing isn't the only aspect of The Conjuring 2 that"

That's a scary image, no? It's weird and funny and wrong and totally transfixing - it makes you want to see more. Well apparently director James Wan agreed, but in this case ""more"" turned out to be ""too much."" That shot actually never ends up in the final movie - what does end up in the movie is a CG'd tangle of technicolor monstrosity, a so-called ""Crooked Man"" (which is admittedly a terrific little moniker) twitching and banging down the haunted house's hallways, poking its Burton-esque umbrella through walls and spoiling all the fun. It's disappointing because the original film, for all its flaws - and I wasn't as enamored with it as most people seemed to be - knew how to keep itself situated firmly inside its own walls. Yes it was the ""everything but the kitchen sink"" approach, but of the old-fashioned sort just turned up to twelve - you want some jump scares we'll give you eleven jump scares. That sort of thing. And a lot of the sequel sticks to that routine too, until that blasted special effect, a silly goosed Babadook, stampeded across my patience. The Crooked Man is a problem, but he's only one trick up the movie's sleeve, and as with the first film it's got more arms than it can handle, so even with some wonky ones some of them still turn out to work. Wan's ripping himself and my preferred horror franchise of his (the Insidious movies) off with that Nun Demon thing... not to mention the Adrienne Barbeau classic The Convent but the Nun Demon thing (and every time I write that I imagine Nicolas Winding Refn's film The Neon Demon actually being called The Nun Demon and my mind reels) is a blast all the same, I giggled and cringed every time it showed up. It's perfectly silly and appropriate for this franchise's universe, and I liked it very much. Also as a spoilery side-note do take note of the mid-film scene set inside the Warrens house where Vera Farmiga's at the kitchen table -- if you look behind Vera, and I mean if you look behind her from all the multiple angles the movie shows her from, you will see a certain name that will come in handy to remember for later in the film. It is ridiculous - the name is on every wall of their house, and their daughter is making a beaded-necklace with the name in it. Anyway I appreciate The Conjuring films and what Wan's trying to do - jumble the haunted house genre into door-creaking chaos for the next generation - more than I ever entirely enjoy them, much less find them all that frightening. Part of me appreciates their dopey sincerity in relation to religiousness, and part of me is unable to suspend my disbelief in order to catch myself up"
286,SHM_Doc6_The_Conjuring_2,SHM_Doc6_The_Conjuring_2,SHM,Horror,Positive,The_Conjuring_2,"It's hard to forget just how viscerally James Wan terrified us in his 2013 critically acclaimed horror hit The Conjuring. That gloomy aesthetic that both haunts you and leaves your skin crawling is no one-hit-wonder. The Conjuring 2 is based on the Enfield Poltergeist, a case that the film describes as England's Amityville. One of the strengths of The Conjuring was the acting that came from Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as the married evil-fighting duo of Ed and Lorraine Warren. Farmiga is simply too enchanting and would not seem out of place even with a halo superimposed on her head. Her chemistry with Wilson is palpable, both emitting a warm light that simply makes you feel safe. The reason why these two people work is because of their steadfast nature as people, they are sure of themselves even in the worst of situations. They are able to inspire courage within the terrified Hodgson family while battling demons of their own. Wan captures atmospheric rainy London perfectly, giving it a gothic quality that adds to his horrific aesthetic. Every scene has a purpose, from marked silences to tilted camera angles. He turns a family's home into a living nightmare. The ability to cause a constant feeling of unease makes for a great horror flick. Even without the fear of a jump scare that serves to yank a yelp from your lips he keeps the air anxious. While The Conjuring 2 delivers nothing seemingly new to the genre, this is not really a true fault of the film. It masterfully plays on classic horror fear tactics. Typical things peppered throughout the genre draw new breath in The Conjuring 2  the pale-faced demonic nun, the possessed child, the murderously hateful old man, the boogeyman, the daytime haunting, the death omen  they evolve to take their final form in a intricately crafted story. What makes it masterful is that Wan manages to twist all of those fears together into one tangible enemy that has countless ways to get to you. The oldest trick in the book is the reminder that a story is ""based on a true story"", but even if the story were to be fiction it pokes and prods at your confidence until it achieves its goal of leaving you petrified. The real-life story of the Warrens' cases are chilling enough (not to mention those real audio recordings and the eerie facts surrounding the cast), Wan doesn't seek to embellish too much on his own, simply enough to draw his story apart from so many that follow a similar vein. Perhaps this is how Wan succeeds where so many others have failed, his story doesn't feel farfetched. It feels real, and it makes us believe that we are witnessing this 'true story'. More fantastical scenes are debunked but still hold the same feeling of fear, while things like levitation and demonic voices have their own unnerving hard evidence. The only downside of The Conjuring 2 is that it shows"
287,SHM_Doc7_The_Conjuring_2,SHM_Doc7_The_Conjuring_2,SHM,Horror,Positive,The_Conjuring_2,"Over the past decade and a half, James Wan has proven that he knows how to frighten us. From the original ""Saw,"" to the two ""Insidious"" films and the first ""Conjuring"" (and to a lesser extent his sophomore effort ""Dead Silence""), he has demonstrated a keen eye for setting up tension, as well as knowing just the right moment to release it. While his brief detour into the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise showed he has the potential to be more versatile than just a horror director, he has returned to scare audiences once again with ""The Conjuring 2."" Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are in the midst of investigating the infamous Amityville house when Lorraine has a vision of a white-faced demon dressed like a nun. This vision haunts her well beyond Amityville, following them to their own home. It frightens Lorraine so much that she asks Ed if they can take some time off from their investigation activities. In the meantime, Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) and her four children are experiencing strange occurrences at their house in the London borough of Enfield. Her daughter Janet ends up becoming the focus of the malevolent spirit haunting their home. She has terrible nightmares, is teleported to other rooms while she sleeps and, eventually, becomes the conduit for the spirit's voice. Enough public attention begins to surround the haunting that the church asks the Warrens to investigate. They reluctantly agree, joining the paranormal investigators who have already been on the case, a couple of whom believe that this is a hoax. ""The Conjuring 2"" is a strong follow up to its utterly frightening predecessor. Wan uses that expert eye to ratchet up the tension during the scare scenes, including many creative camera angles and lens choices to focus our attention to certain areas of a shot, which may or may not be where you should be looking. He also loads the film with plenty of jump scares, the hallmark of many a ghost story. While there are several nice and spooky moments throughout the movie, overall it's not quite as scary as the first outing with the Warrens. This is not a bad thing, though. Let me explain. ""The Conjuring 2"" is an anomaly among horror sequels. Almost all of them to this point have focused on the villain: Your Jason's, Freddy's or Ghostface's. The ""Conjuring"" films are focused on the Warrens. This brings a whole different dynamic to them. Instead of straight-forward horror, these films are essentially spooky relationship dramas. The Warrens know the dangers they face every time the take on a new case, yet they know, or at least hope, that their love for each other and devout faith will get them through it. This time around, though, Lorraine is very concerned that things might turn out different. It's not just the Warrens' relationship that the films focus on, though. In both movies, we get to know the families being affected, and get to know"

Nice. Eventually, she comes round, freaked as hell. Fast forward one year to 1977, and the suburban surroundings of Enfield, London. A young girl, Janet (Wolfe), claims to be being plagued by the spirit of an old man who used to own the house. Naturally, nobody believes her and the things that go bump in the night continue unabated. The Conjuring 2 begins with a similar aesthetic to the 2013 original, it has the same main protagonists and that's about where the comparisons end. Unfortunately, the sequel to James Wan's hugely successful original doesn't live up to its predecessor, and ultimately is a disappointment. The running time is far too long, 2 hours 14 mins, resulting in a bloated, slow story. The need to provide backstory to this (very famous) haunting case is essential, and also to introduce the Hodgson family as well, however this drags in for far too long and becomes uninteresting. It takes over an hour for the Warrens to head to London, and when they do the story plods along again, only picking up pace at the polished, unsatisfying and rushed conclusion. The original Conjuring is 45 minutes shorter, and ends up being a tighter, better film because of this. I became nauseated at the 1970's 'Enfield' accents, especially in the film's first acts  it almost seemed as if James Wan directed the cast to mock the London accent, and then make it worse. Really grating, and unusually, the natives of Enfield don't speak like that... For me it created a disparity as the Warrens accents clashed with the Hodgson mockney voices, it really took me out of the movie. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are good performers, and continue to be so in The Conjuring 2. There's nothing about their performances which degrade the movie, however the decision to make Ed an everyman stuck out like a sore thumb  there was literally nothing he couldn't do/fix/prevent. Whoever decided to allow the scene of Ed serenading the family with Elvis Presley needs to have their head examined  Wilson does a fine job of crooning, but it's just so against the tone of the movie it becomes parody. However, the double act they bring is great; they have a definite chemistry together and really bring a degree of believability to the movie. Madison Wolfe was part of the gang that almost drove me mad during the film opening acts, however, as the movie went on and she became more and more possessed, her performance got better and joined the two leads as the top performers. The rest of the cast though, not so great, lots of wood and rigidness. Franka Potente was"

Just the thought that your own home, your one bastion of solace, could be compromised by a vindictive spirit or demon is a horrifying idea. All of your finances are tied into this building, making it impossible to abandon. Each corner reflects some measure of personal history, making the attachment to each wall far more difficult to separate one's self from. Even worse is knowing your home is being invaded and  despite all of the self-defense classes and weapons a person can muster  you are utterly powerless to stop it. ""The Conjuring 2"" invites the franchise into another haunted dwelling for yet another go-round with a harshly vengeful spirit. Peggy Hodgson (Francis O'Connor) is a single mom raising her brood in a London flat, when suddenly it is besieged by an evil entity. Several attempts to dissuade the demon on her own end in failure, so Peggy takes her case to the media. After her daughter Janet demonstrates what seems like demonic possession on national TV, the Catholic Church regrettably calls on Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) to investigate these claims of a supernatural disturbance. As required with any franchise, the stakes must be raised or the story should carve an alternate path, and this time director James Wan has crafted a film fraught with a modicum of doubt: Could the Hodgson clan ultimately be faking all of this? I can't remember the last time a filmmaker took a look at the flip-side of a house possession. As with the original ""Conjuring"", most spiritually infested domains come with a healthy dose of legitimizing, leading us to inevitably conclude that 'OF COURSE this is real'. We rarely even consider that these ghostly occupiers could be nothing but a ruse. For large sections this film, there is more than enough room to debate. Demons are real, but maybe we keep looking to the devil as the solution, when the real culprit  the more likely instigator  might instead be a mentally damaged pre-teen putting her family through the psychological wringer. It's a fun twist on the norm, and sorely needed as much of the rest of ""The Conjuring 2"" simply regurgitates the plot devices from the original, leaving us in a constant state of unearthly deja vu. Thunderous banging on doors that open to no one, objects relocating on their own, sleepwalking children leading us to ominous relics leading to more banging doors  see where I'm going? As talented a director as James Wan is  and make no mistake, Wan is easily the most spirited purveyor of horror in film today (minus the questionable design choice of 'The Crooked Man')  he cannot mask the eerie sensation of sequelitis that begins to seep into our bones midway through the film. For a filmmaker who stages scenarios of spine-tinglingly perfectionist glee, it is relatively shocking to witness cinematic doppelgangers of the previous film. More surprising are the"

A sequel was inevitable, especially since there's a tall pile of stories to choose from involving real-life ghost hunters Ed and Lorraine Warren, (played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga). The Conjuring 2 begins in 1977, with the Warrens' involvement in the aftermath of the ""Amityville Horror"" case, and them trying to fight the growing public belief that the whole thing was a hoax. They, of course, have no doubts it was all true, especially after Lorraine sees a demon that looks like Marilyn Manson in a nun habit walking around the house's basement. This demon follows them home, and its presence, and visions of Ed's death, convince Lorraine they should stop taking cases and instead stay home and continue to ignore their teenage daughter. (Seriously, I was convinced she was a ghost, there's so little attention paid to her.) Meanwhile, in Enfield, England, newly divorced mother Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) and her four children are dealing with weird things in their new home. And I'm not talking about the house's disturbingly dirty walls, or the four foot deep bog of water in the basement. Strange noises, furniture being pushed by invisible hands, and youngest daughter Janet's (Madison Wolfe) sleepwalking/sleeptalking episodes eventually force the Hodgson family to, in one of the film's welcome moments of levity, literally run out of the house screaming. Janet becomes the focus of a ghost named ""Bill,"" who speaks through her in a chain smoker's rasp, claiming the house is his, and that he died in a old leather armchair in the living room. That's the kind of information that would have me instantly picking up the phone to schedule a big trash day pick-up, but of course the Hodgsons decide to keep it. (It really does tie the depressingly decrepit room together.) The case becomes the focus of a BBC special, (you can watch the real one here), and when none of England's supernatural investigators are able to help the family rid themselves of Bill, the Warrens are called in by the Catholic church, to see if they can prove the haunting is real, so the church can do a sanctioned exorcism. So, despite Lorraine's misgivings about taking on cases, and despite it being Christmastime, and despite them having a teenage daughter who would probably like to spend that Christmas with her creepy parents, the Warrens arrive in England to do some ghost busting. The Enfield case has been called England's Amityville, and it's true there are similarities, the biggest being they were both eventually deemed enormous hoaxes. The real Janet was caught on film banging a broom on the ceiling, bending spoons, and hiding tape recorders. While there are several hours of audio recordings of ""Bill,"" there are only a few seconds of film where we can see Janet speaking in his voice. The movie doesn't ignore this skepticism. In"

It sees him reprising his role of Secret Service Superman Mike Banning. To be honest I had fun with the first film ""Olympus Has Fallen"". It was a silly, fun throwback to the meat-headed action movies of the early 90's. ""London Has Fallen"" failed miserably at capturing what made the first film entertaining. ""Angel"" falls somewhere in the middle. Stuntman turned director Ric Roman Waugh helms this sequel that essentially follows the same blueprint as the previous films. Mike Banning is recommended by President Alan Trumball (Morgan Freeman) to replace the retiring Secret Service Director (played by the always fun Lance Reddick). But as the series has shown us, the job can take a pretty big toll and Banning's body and psyche is letting him know it. Hilariously this seemingly important story-thread vanishes once the action kicks in. While out on a country fishing trip, an assassination attempt is carried out with a swarm of high-tech drones. Banning barely saves the President's life but everyone else including his Secret Service team are killed. The two lone survivors are taken back to Washington where the President is comatose and Banning finds himself framed for the attack. It doesn't take much investigating before a tunnel-visioned FBI Agent Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith) puts Banning under arrest. So much for all of that 'service to his country' bull. Of course like any good Gerry Butler movie, Mike doesn't take it sitting down. He breaks out of custody and sets out to find who framed him and who wants the President dead. He has to seek the help of the last person he wants to see  his father Clay (Nick Nolte), a wooly, off-the-grid mountain hermit who (as you can probably guess) ran out on his family when Mike was a child. That is clearly the go-to offense for scorned fathers in movies. Nolte's character adds a little levity but there is little new or fresh about him beyond that.As you should expect, ""Angel Has Fallen"" leans heavily on its action. Some of it is fairly exciting and well shot. Other times it can be pretty generic, even frustrating especially when the scene-killing shaky-cam kicks in. And it's all built around a paper-thin plot full of logic-defying silliness and ridiculous conveniences that are just there to get the story from Point A to Point B. By the way, am I the only one who wants to scream when a character won't say the most obvious and necessary thing simply because a storyline hinges on their silence? So basically this is another film worthy of being in Gerry Butler's filmography. But feeling like a silver-lining kind of guy, I will say this is a step up from most of Butler's recent efforts. Nolte earns a few chuckles, I really liked Danny Huston as one of Banning's old military buddies, and the action can sometimes muster up some thrills. But"

This is the third time he's been called upon to save the US president from assassination and just to raise the degree of difficulty another notch, his Secret Service agent, Mike Banning, has to do it while on the run from the law. Showing a shameful disregard for his past record, his former employers are accusing him of mounting the latest assassination attempt. Nick Nolte and Gerard Butler are father and son in Angel Has Fallen (2019). To be fair, they have their reasons. The real culprits have put a lot of effort into framing him but we soon discover who they are and how they did it. While the FBI and the Secret Service remain in the dark, the script lets us in on the secret, successfully tucking the necessary bits of exposition into a series of action sequences which leave you little to time to think of anything other than the rapidly accelerating toll in collateral damage. We have a new president this time round. Possibly suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, Aaron Eckhart has retired from the role. He announced some time ago that his presidential alter ego would be going off to play golf and tend his presidential library. It's now the turn of Morgan Freeman, making his first return to the Oval Office in 21 years. He was in charge when a comet hit the Earth and obliterated much of it in 1998's Deep Impact. This time, the threats are closer to home, as you may guess the minute you set eyes on Danny Huston. He's an actor whose busy career has been based almost entirely on his talent for playing fork-tongued villains. Jada Pinkett Smith is here, too, cast as an FBI agent who remains unimpressed by Banning's claims of innocence, but the big surprise is Nick Nolte. After surviving a succession of shootouts, bombings and car crashes, Banning heads into the woods to find a hiding place and Nolte staggers out from behind a tree. He's playing Banning's father, Clay, a Vietnam veteran whose experience of the war has turned him into a recluse as well as souring him on the government and all its wars. And although he looks very much the worse for wear, he can still summon up the enthusiasm to pump some much needed pep into the dialogue. Butler, who's also looking very tired, perks up considerably once they begin to banter. And despite Clay's anti-war rhetoric, he still has use for his weapons training. During the next stand-off, he manages to blow up much of the forest, together with scores of bad guys The commercial success of this franchise has always been governed by its directors' ability to deliver the films at a cost deemed to be modest by Hollywood blockbuster standards.

In the follow-up to 2013's ""Olympus Has Fallen"" and 2016's ""London Has Fallen"", and in a revisiting no one really asked for, Gerard Butler returns for a paycheck as Mike Banning  great action hero name, no?  an aging secret service agent struggling with physical impairments that should, one would think, disqualify him from working as the primary line of defense for the President of the United States. In the first two films, our president was played by Aaron Eckhart, and while he must have passed on the titillating chance of not-performing Shakespeare for a third time, we are left with Morgan Freeman, ever an amazing president, voice of God, omniscient narrator, etc. Freeman was also in the two previous films as Speaker of the House, and so it is finally his turn to be hit with unimaginable assassination attempts via tricked-out smart drones with facial recognition capabilities and lots of ammo. Banning is purposefully kept alive, and he dashes on his speedboat to the president, forcing them both under water until the *explosion, explosion, explosion* end. Everyone else is dead. The president falls into a coma, and Banning is under arrest for the slaughter of his security team. Because he is the only one who survived and, despite his track record of staying alive in impossible situations, this one is apparently too outrageous to be anything more than malicious intent. Mid-transfer, his transport car is hijacked and Banning is taken hostage by the real perpetrators whom he handily defeats and escapes. On the lam, Banning has no choice but to seek shelter from his hermit father (Nick Nolte) who left him as a child and has been roughing it in the woods. When the guys who set him up manage to find him, Banning takes control of the situation (read: more explosions, car chases, yada yada) and is drawn to do the job he's done all his adult life: protect and serve. The president, waking from the coma, is in grave danger and Banning is somehow the only person to see it coming. He is the president's only chance at survival, and he weasels his way back to the president's side just in time for the final showdown. In terms of its watchability rating, ""Angel Has Fallen"" isn't the worst action film ever made. Its premise is ridiculous, and its ""twist"" is obvious to anyone with eyes, ears and/or half a brain cell. However, that doesn't mean it's not a fun time. Butler takes his role quite seriously, which actually helps us get through some of the outlandish slog we have to wade through to get to the better bits. The action is high-tech and adrenaline-boosting, and with the talent of veterans Freeman, Nolte, Jada Pinkett Smith underused as an obtuse FBI agent and Danny Huston as Banning's ex-military turned private sector entrepreneur buddy, it isn't hard to let"

Every subsequent film is significantly worse in quality, and yet here we are, on part three of sucksville. angel-has-fallen-1200 Angel, for those not keeping track, is the third film after Olympus and London Has Fallen. We are back in the shoes of modern day John McLaine Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), who must once again save the president of the US from a terror attack. This time, to throw in something new Banning is framed, and the entire secret service is after him because they think he is the one who wants POTUS dead. If you have been brought up on a diet of thrillers in the '90s, you will be reminded very quickly that this film is very much like The Fugitive. In fact, there is a moment in the third act, which is exactly like a moment in the finale of that movie. But if this was intended to be a homage, it is quite a mediocre one because at no point does this movie thrill or surprise  everything is so stale and cold you wonder how this film managed to time travel a couple decades. There is no focus on pacing, or an element of well earned revelation, or any ingenuity in delivering suspense, or even a modicum of well constructed action thrills  the whole thing is a dumb meathead of a movie that just drones on for far too long, and shows you something that is two hours too late. It is, however, designed for a particular kind of audience  the one that loves pulpy actioners that put the president in danger  and on that front this is a very well-oiled machine. Morgan Freeman plays the POTUS in a believably compassionate way. Butler is flexing his biceps, jumping into lakes to save him is only going to to render MAGA boners to audiences who dig this stuff. Butler's 'investigation' is also treated in a predictably over-dramatic manner, which culminates in a ridiculous man-to-man fight with the bad guy  which is only going to make those who love this franchise clap real hard. The odd thing is this is the only movie in the trilogy that features acceptable acting performances, so all the corny plotting is swept under the rug. There is little else to recommend or talk about in this film because it is such a big ball of nothingness. It does, however, make you question why Butler's career trajectory, which began with a bang in 300, is now reduced to this junk. You could get aboard a drinking game about which element would be targeting POTUS in the next film, and which action movie cliche would Banning be utilizing to combat the villain. And going by Butler's haggard look in this movie, one would not be surprised to see"
295,SRL_Doc5_Angel_Has_Fallen,SRL_Doc5_Angel_Has_Fallen,SRL,Action,Positive,Angel_Has_Fallen,"To recap: first the White House was attacked. Not White House Down  that was PG-13 with Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx. I'm speaking of Olympus Has Fallen, rated R, with Gerard Butler as Mike Banning and Morgan Freeman as Secretary of Defense Allan Trumbull. And then it went international with London Has Fallen, with all of the world leaders as targets when they are in England to attend a funeral. Then there was Hunter Killer, but that was about a submarine commander, not a Secret Service agent. Still, it was a fate-of-the-world shoot-em-up, so we'll include it as an affiliate member of the GBU (Gerard Butler Universe). That brings us to chapter three of the Banning/Trumbull saga, and, as they like to say in movie trailers, this time it's personal. ""Angel Has Fallen"" is about another attack on the President. But this time what, or I should say, who has fallen is Banning himself. Trumbull has gone from Defense Secretary to Vice President, and now President, and Banning is up for the job of head of the Secret Service. But he has two reasons to be reluctant to accept. First, he is feeling the effect of his concussions and other injuries and is popping a lot of pain pills. Second, he dreads the thought of a desk job. The action is what makes him feel alive. On a fishing trip, the President is attacked  a stunning scene featuring drones swarming together like demonic birds via artificial intelligence and facial recognition. Banning, who had asked to be relieved because his headache was overpowering, returns just in time to rescue Trumbull, but everyone else on the detail is killed. Banning has been framed; there is a deposit of $10 million from Russia in his bank account. An FBI agent (Jada Pinkett Smith) is after him. Banning is Angel and he has fallen. He has to go on the run, off the grid, to find out what is happening, clear his name, and still keep the President safe. And so we get to find out something about Banning's past, and about the way intense, adrenaline-pumping peril can become addicting. I've had a problem in the past with the careless collateral damage in this series, and that continues to be a problem. Even a mindless popcorn action movie where the ""surprise"" bad guys are instantly recognizable has to be careful about staying within the parameters of fun chases and shoot-em-ups and explosions, not too heavy on the carnage. That is an even bigger issue this time, as Banning's character and struggles are a part of the storyline. Making him a character with more dimensions, maybe one and a half or two but not three, just means more of an adjustment every time we swing into one of the big stunt extravaganzas. Is it all the excitement that has Banning no longer needing to chomp down pain pills all the time? It might have been more intriguing to see him try to outsmart"
296,SRL_Doc6_Angel_Has_Fallen,SRL_Doc6_Angel_Has_Fallen,SRL,Action,Positive,Angel_Has_Fallen,"No, it's not a typo. Angel Has Fallen is a four-star movie. The brazenly idiotic Has Fallen franchise (previous episodes were Olympus and London), which has been defined by sloppy action beats and perturbing American triumphalism (Take that, North Korea! And that, Middle East!) has somehow hit its stride third time round. This happens in movies. The ""third time's a charm"" rule has applied to everything from Goldfinger (third and best James Bond movie) to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (third and best Clint Eastwood ""Man with No Name"" western) to Toy Story 3. And The Bourne Ultimatum. And Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Point being, by the third movie a franchise will often find its feet, or discover a particular groove or rhythm that was absent in the first two instalments. Play Video In Angel Has Fallen that new groove is the wheezy angsty ineptitude of middle age. Franchise star Gerard Butler is back, of course, playing the US secret service superagent Mike Banning, the loyal personal bodyguard of President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman). Yet this time, as the movie opens, with a routine stolen from the Bond film Never Say Never Again (a training exercise disguised as real jeopardy), Banning is revealed to be addicted to painkillers and suffering from panic attacks and embarrassing dizzy spells. He loses his balance on the job, like a peaky high street pensioner overloaded with groceries, and when, barely three scenes in, he goes for an emergency check-up (his fourth visit, we learn, in as many months  the big hypo) the doctor warns him that his spine is a ""disaster"" and that he's one well-aimed headbutt away from permanent paralysis. This is great material, and Butler, now 49 and wearing every minute of it, is perfect for the part. There's not a hint of the gym here. No vanity pec-flex nonsense either (take note, Dwayne Johnson). Instead, with a touch of softly curving moobs and some dad-bod love handles, and with that crazy ""American"" Glas-Angeles accent, Butler still manages to exude an effortless and earthy masculinity, a kind, as the poet WB Yeats might have said, that is unnatural in an age like this. Banning, alas, doesn't have much time to process his impending mental breakdown. After two short scenes that establish his domestic bliss (slightly undercut by shots of our hero popping pills behind the bedroom door) with his supportive wife, Leah (Piper Perabo, taking over doting duties from Radha Mitchell), Banning is called back into action when a former army buddy and bigwig military contractor called Wade (Danny Huston, just delicious) goes rogue, kills half the secret service, sends Trumbull into a coma, sets up Banning as the prime suspect, and begins to initiate a war with Russia. Advertisement OK, so it's not Dostoyevsky, but the plot isn't the thing. It's how the plot unfolds that counts. It makes no sense, for instance, for Wade to set up Banning as the patsy assassin, because Wade's"
297,SRL_Doc7_Angel_Has_Fallen,SRL_Doc7_Angel_Has_Fallen,SRL,Action,Positive,Angel_Has_Fallen,"It wouldn't take much for ""Angel Has Fallen"" to become the best installment in a most unlikely franchise. The adventures of Mike Banning, powerhouse Secret Service agent, began in 2013's ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" and continued with 2016's ""London Has Fallen,"" with the pictures primarily out to create a cartoon realm for the heroic character, keeping him battered but never broken, always ready for a rah-rah-America pose to light up the crowds. The series has found its audience, but anything resembling a creative achievement has been missing. ""Angel Has Fallen"" isn't a complete break from the ""Fallen"" formula, but the writing isn't obsessed with jaw-pumping acts of aggression, preferring, for the first time, to treat Mike as a human being between scenes of bodily harm. There's something more interesting going on in the movie, which provides a decent adrenaline shot of action while still managing some tender areas of fragility. Mike (Gerard Butler) is getting older, and past acts of heroism have caught up with him, leaving him concussed, electing to gobble pain pills to keep himself steady. Trying to support his wife, Leah (Piper Perabo), and their young daughter, Mike remains by the side of President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman), who's about to offer his top agent a job as head of the Secret Service. While on vacation, Trumbull is attacked by explosive drones, killing everyone except for the President and Mike, who wakes up in a hospital, under arrest for an assassination attempt funded by the Russians. Confused, Mike realizes he's being framed, soon escaping custody and setting out to clear his name. Offering connections are Mike's military pal, Wade (Danny Huston), and his father, Clay (Nick Nolte), who abandoned his son as a child. With Vice President Kirby (Time Blake Nelson) assuming power, ready to declare war on Russia, Mike has limited time to find the real culprits and save Trumbull, who remains in a coma, protected in a hospital. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" was basically a remake of ""Die Hard,"" turning Mike into John McClane, keeping him cocky and merciless when it came to dispatching bad guys. Such bravado remained in ""London Has Fallen,"" but ""Angel Has Fallen"" finds Mike as McClane in ""Die Hard with a Vengeance,"" showing some serious wear and tear as his brain is being turned into jelly after surviving numerous violent events. He's prone to dizzy spells and buying pills from sketchy doctors, trying to keep himself steady for the job, refusing to expose weakness while on the verge of a possible promotion. Butler takes to the new character direction with palpable enthusiasm, permitted to play a person for the first time in the series, dropping the action figure act to communicate Mike's pain and fear as he tries to keep his secrets out of view. There's also a change in tone with ""Angel Has Fallen,"" finding Mike on the run as he's targeted by an unknown antagonist who uses media manipulation to turn the hero into a villain, allowing the script to create"
298,SRL_Doc8_Angel_Has_Fallen,SRL_Doc8_Angel_Has_Fallen,SRL,Action,Positive,Angel_Has_Fallen,"Angel Has Fallen may not be appreciably better than the first two installments of this lower-middle-range Mission: Impossible wannabe franchise, but it's actually more fun  first and foremost because of a vastly amusing turn by Nick Nolte as Gerard Butler's eccentric Vietnam vet old coot father. Outfitted with a dizzying body count and robust R-rated mayhem, this late summer action entry brandishes a small war's worth of bloody violence and heavy artillery to lure boys young and old to theaters, where the 2013 and 2016 entries both landed in the $200 million box office range worldwide. The first thing you can't help but notice is that Butler is getting a bit puffy around the gills as he pushes 50; not only that, but the president's personal Secret Service macho man Mike Banning is experiencing disorienting dizzy spells that suggest that a move from the field to a desk job may be in order. Still, it doesn't take long for Banning to once again prove that one of him, however diminished he may be, is worth a dozen of anyone else when it comes to protecting the President of the United States, who, in a bit of wish-fulfillment fantasizing, is played by Morgan Freeman and not, let's say, by Alec Baldwin. In an elaborate set piece notable for its body count, President Allan Trumbull's entire security staff is wiped out while protecting the chief executive during a fishing expedition not far from Washington; only his personal bodyguard, Banning, manages to keep the president alive during this frightful onslaught by what look like brilliantly trained mercenaries. But what thanks does he get for his heroism? Instant blame for the whole bloody fiasco from Vice President Kirby (Tim Blake Nelson), who insists that Banning is in cahoots with the Russians, has him charged with the attempted murder of the president and is immediately sworn in as acting president. Gerard Butler Reteaming With 'Angel Has Fallen' Director for Thriller 'Greenland' From here, screenwriters Robert Mark Kamen, Matt Cook and Ric Roman Waugh  the latter of whom also directed, as he did on the previous series entry  clearly spent most of their creative energy figuring out multiple ways in which Banning could wriggle out of seemingly inescapable predicaments, get caught or subdued again, then bust his way out to fight yet another day. Kirby's first hours as president don't go very well, as Banning slips through his fingers in short order. Waugh's background is as a stuntman, and he no doubt put a lot of his old cohorts to work on this one; bodies go flying every 20 minutes or so, as Banning at one point escapes in, of all things, a big rig, and you begin to think you're bearing witness to the reincarnation of Hal Needham. It's all utterly preposterous, and yet Waugh handles the big scenes pretty well, or at least well enough (and with sufficient self-aware humor) that you're willing to go along with Banning's mad attempt to"
299,SRL_Doc9_Angel_Has_Fallen,SRL_Doc9_Angel_Has_Fallen,SRL,Action,Negative,Angel_Has_Fallen,"Olympus Has Fallen was arguably the better of 2013's two Die Hard-In-The-Oval-Office movies, pipping White House Down by pitting Gerard Butler's Secret Service alpha male Mike Banning as a one-man-army against an endless stream of North Korean wrong 'uns, armed with only his wits and his walkie-talkie quips. Like Die Hard, it was claustrophobic, pacy and fun (if not entirely worthy to lick John McClane's glass-spattered feet)  and like Die Hard, it has spawned a franchise of somewhat diminishing returns. This is a series that featured dialogue ranging from the action-movie gold (""Let's play a game of fuck off  you go first"") to the unintentionally hilarious (""I'm thirsty as fuck!"") to the simply offensive (""go back to Fuckheadistan!""). Gerard Butler certainly has a niche, and knows it. But while he seems like an actor who doesn't take himself too seriously, Angel Has Fallen curiously does. There is none of the sly pisstakery that the first two films had, and, at least until a spectacularly miscalculated mid-credits scene, a sober tone throughout. Angel Has Fallen The inner turmoil of Mike Banning, then? Nobody really asked to get under the skin of the man once self-described as made of ""bourbon and poor choices""  but that's what we're getting, as Banning's years of action heroics catch up with him, suffering from migraines and pill addictions. ""You're a disaster waiting to happen,'' a doctor tells him, which might be too easy a gift to more unforgiving critics. The action hovers between good and just adequate. After palling around with an old army buddy played by Danny Huston (and you can always absolutely, definitely trust a Danny Huston character) Banning finds himself on the run  the guardian angel of the title, his reputation in tatters. Like the last film, the expanded geography means that original claustrophobia is gone, and there are certainly times when it feels like a generic action B-movie. Elite high-tech baddies, cyber warfare, vagaries about the military industrial complex, evil Russkies  you will know the drill. The action hovers between good and just adequate. Budget constraints can occasionally be felt; some VFX shots seem lifted from a PlayStation2 cutscene. Other sequences are worryingly incoherent  worst among them a fight in a car, at night, with the lights off, shot in close-ups and so choppily edited that it's not actually clear who's winning. But as far as Gerard Butler action vehicles go, it could have been a lot worse. There's less guilty-pleasure silliness, but also less ugly jingoism, which is welcome. And in the final act, it harkens back to the series' bread-and-butter: a Secret Service under fire, protecting the primary asset at all costs, full of tension and terror. It even allows, amid all the machismo, for some vulnerability in Banning Sr, a Vietnam vet played by Nick Nolte with remarkable sensitivity. At least until he starts setting off C4 in a forest. So it goes."

Need a new transmission? See a mechanic. But if your government is under attack, the only name you need in your little black book is Mike Banning, Secret Service agent, former U.S. Army Ranger, protector of presidents and other heads of state. Banningas portrayed by Scottish actor Gerard Butlerhas dodged many a bullet (both physically and figuratively) in two previous movies, not to mention a number of other, much more combustive close calls. Angel Has Fallen Starring Gerard Butler & Morgan Freeman R Directed by Ric Roman Waugh In theaters Aug. 23, 2019 Banning, the character, and Butler, the actor, both return to their posts in Angel Has Fallen, which continues in the tradition of Olympus Has Fallen (2013) and London Has Fallen (2016). It's a red-meat grinder of gunfire and pyro built atop a gonzo storyline of implausible political implosion, an astonishing amount of carnage and, at this particular moment in time, a tone-deaf disregard for the mood of much of the nation for seeing dozens of people mowed down by all kinds of military-grade weaponry, often at point-blank range. In Angel Has Fallen, Banning is framed for an assassination attempt on U.S. President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman). In previous films, Trumbull was speaker of the house, then vice president. Who better than Morgan Freeman to work his way up into the Oval Office? The versatile Oscar winner, whose all-star movie resume includes Million Dollar Baby, Driving Miss Daisy, Glory, the Batman/Dark Knight franchise, Se7en, The Shawshank Redemption and Now You See Me, certainly gets my vote! (But waitafter being God, in Bruce Almighty, isn't president a bit of, um, a demotion?) Anyway, of course, Banningloyal as a collie, smart as a sheltie, protective as a pit bulldidn't do it. But who did? And why? That's what you'll spend half the movie wondering, until the movie conveniently lays it all in your lap (make sure you're finished with your popcorn). Then you'll wonder how Banningby then a fugitive, on the lamclears his name, where it's all headed and how it'll get there, when the prez will pop out of his coma, and where Banning acquired all the tools in his amazing, secret-service skill set. How did he learn how to pick open a set of handcuffs (in the dark!) with a scavenged, paper-clip-sized part from an assault rifle? How does he know (just know!) the geo-satellite coordinates of a tiny, remote, rural spot of nowhere? How does he walk through a thicket of woods right up to what has to be the only remaining roadside pay phone in all of West Virginia? In a clunky, overtly obvious attempt to appear timely, the script drops in pointed references to Russian collusion, election tampering, hackers, the dark web and press leaks.
